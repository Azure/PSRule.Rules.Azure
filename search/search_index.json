How do I create a custom rule to enforce resource group tagging? # PSRule for Azure covers common use cases that align to the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework . Use of resource and resource group tags is recommended in the WAF , however implementation may vary. You may want to use PSRule to enforce tagging or something similar early in a DevOps pipeline. We have a walk through scenario Enforcing custom tags to get you started. How do I create a custom rule to enforce code ownership? # GitHub, Azure DevOps, and other DevOps platforms may implement code ownership. This process involves assigning a team or an individual review and approval responsibility. In GitHub or Azure DevOps implementation, ownership is linked to the file path. When a repository contains resources that different teams would approve how do you: Ensure resources are created in a path that triggers the correct approval? We have a walk through scenario Enforcing code ownership to get you started. Do you have sample code? # In addition to the walk through scenarios, we have a quick start template here . The repository contains sample ARM templates, Bicep, and pipeline code to get you started. In GitHub you can simply use the repository as a template for your own project. Do I need PowerShell experience to start using PSRule for Azure? # No. You can start using built-in rules and CI with Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions. If we didn't tell you, you might not even know that PowerShell runs under the covers. To perform local validation, some PowerShell setup is required but we step you through that. See installation and validating locally for details. To start writing your own custom rules you can use YAML, JSON, or PowerShell. PowerShell experience is required for some scenarios.

What permissions do I need to analyze exported rule data? # When exporting data for in-flight analysis, no access to Azure is required after data has been exported to JSON. Should I continue to use Azure Advisor, Security Center, or Azure Policy? # Absolutely. PSRule for Azure does not replace Azure Advisor, Security Center, or Azure Policy.

Providing the ability to analyze resources in Azure Resource Manager templates before deployment. Additionally, analysis can be performed in a CI process. Providing the ability to layer on organization specific rules, as required. Data collection requires limited permissions and requires no additional configuration. What do the different severity and levels for rules means? # PSRule for Azure annotates rules with three (3) severities which indicate how you should prioritize remediation. The following severities are defined: Critical \u2014 Consider addressing these first, ideally within the next thirty (30) days. Rules identified as critical often have high impact and are highly likely to affect your services. Important \u2014 Consider addressing these next, ideally within the next sixty (60) days. Rules identified as important often have a significant impact and are likely to affect your services. Awareness \u2014 Consider addressing these last, ideally within the next ninty (90) days. Rules identified as awareness often have a moderate or low impact to the operation of your services. Tip Severities and suggested time frames are an indicator only. They may affect your environment, compliance, or security differently based on your specific requirements. If you feel the severity for a rule is broadly incorrect then please let as know. You can do this by joining or starting a discussion . Additionally, PSRule for Azure uses three (3) rule levels. These levels determine how PSRule provides feedback about failing cases. The following levels are defined: Error \u2014 Rules defined as error will stop CI pipelines that are configured to break on error. Warning \u2014 Rules defined as warning will not stop CI pipelines and will produce a warning. Information \u2014 Rules defined as information will not stop CI pipelines. Traditional unit testing vs PSRule for Azure? # You may already be using a unit test framework such as Pester to test infrastructure code. If you are, then you may have encountered the following challenges. For a general PSRule/ Pester comparison see How is PSRule different to Pester? Unit testing more than basic JSON structure # Unit tests are unable to effectively test resources contained within Azure templates. Templates should be reusable, but this creates problems for testing when functions, conditions and copy loops are used. Template parameters could completely change the type, number of, or configuration of resources. PSRule resolves templates to allow analysis of the resources that would be deployed based on provided parameters. Standard library of tests # When building unit tests for Azure resources, starting with an empty repository can be a daunting experience. While there are several open source repositories and samples around to get you started, you need to integrate these yourself. PSRule for Azure is distributed as a PowerShell module using the PowerShell Gallery. Using a PowerShell module makes it easy to install and update. The built-in rules allow you starting testing resources quickly, with minimal integration. For detailed examples see: Validate Azure resources from templates with Azure Pipelines Validate Azure resources from templates with continuous integration ( CI ) Collection of telemetry # PSRule and PSRule for Azure currently do not collect any telemetry during installation or execution.

You can do this by joining or starting a discussion . Additionally, PSRule for Azure uses three (3) rule levels. These levels determine how PSRule provides feedback about failing cases. The following levels are defined: Error \u2014 Rules defined as error will stop CI pipelines that are configured to break on error. Warning \u2014 Rules defined as warning will not stop CI pipelines and will produce a warning. Information \u2014 Rules defined as information will not stop CI pipelines.","title":"What do the different severity and levels for rules means?"},{"location":"faq/#traditional-unit-testing-vs-psrule-for-azure","text":"You may already be using a unit test framework such as Pester to test infrastructure code.

An earlier version of Az.Accounts is imported # When running PSRule for Azure in Azure DevOps within the AzurePowerShell@5 task, you may see the following error. Error This module requires Az.Accounts version 2.8.0. An earlier version of Az.Accounts is imported in the current PowerShell session. Please open a new session before importing this module. This error could indicate that multiple incompatible versions of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets are installed on your system. Please see https://aka.ms/azps-version-error for troubleshooting information. This error is raised by a chained dependency failure importing a newer version of Az.Accounts . To avoid this issue attempt to install the exact versions of Az.Resources . In the AzurePowerShell@5 task before installing PSRule. Install-Module Az . Resources -RequiredVersion '5.6.0' -Force -Scope CurrentUser From PSRule for Azure v1.16.0, Az.Accounts and Az.Resources are no longer installed as dependencies. When using export commands from PSRule, you may need to install these modules. To install these modules, use the following PowerShell command: Install-Module Az . Resources -Force -Scope CurrentUser Bicep compilation timeout # When expanding Bicep source files you may get an error similar to the following: Error Bicep (0.4.1124) compilation of 'C:\\temp\\deploy.bicep' failed with: Bicep compilation hasn't completed within the timeout window. This can be caused by errors or warnings. Check the Bicep output by running bicep build and addressing any issues. This error is raised when Bicep takes longer then the timeout to build a source file. The default timeout is 5 seconds. You can take steps to reduce your code complexity and reduce the time a build takes by: Removing unnecessary nested module calls. Cache bicep modules restored from a registry in continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To increase the timeout value, set the AZURE_BICEP_FILE_EXPANSION_TIMEOUT configuration option. See Bicep compilation timeout for details on how to configure this option. No rules or no Azure resources are found # There is a few common causes of this issue including: Check input format \u2014 PSRule for Azure must discover files to expand them. When running PSRule for Azure using GitHub Actions or the Azure Pipelines extension: Your pipeline must be set to inputType: repository , which is the default value. PSRule for Azure will not work with inputType set to inputPath . You may have set this parameter because you wanted to use the inputPath parameter. Setting the inputType is not a requirement for using the inputPath parameter. The inputPath parameter can be used independently. When running PSRule for Azure from PowerShell: Your command-line must use the -Format File parameter. Your command-line must use the -InputPath or -f parameter followed by a file or directory path. For example: Assert-PSRule -Module PSRule.Rules.Azure -Format File -f 'modules/' . Check expansion is enabled \u2014 Expansion must be enabled to analyze Azure Infrastructure as Code. See using templates and using Bicep source for details on how to enable expansion. Check parameter files are linked \u2014 Parameter files must be linked to ARM templates or Bicep source files. See using templates for details on how to link using metadata or naming convention. Note If your pipeline is still not finding any Azure resources, please join or start a discussion . Custom rules are not running # There is a few common causes of this issue including: Check rule path \u2014 By default, PSRule will look for rules in the .ps-rule/ directory. This directory is the root for your repository or the current working path by default. On case-sensitive file systems such as Linux, this directory name is case-sensitive. See Storing and naming rules for more information. Check file name suffix \u2014 PSRule only looks for files with the .Rule.ps1 , .Rule.yaml , or .Rule.jsonc suffix. On case-sensitive file systems such as Linux, this file siffix is case-sensitive. See Storing and naming rules for more information. Check binding configuration \u2014 PSRule uses binding to work out which property to use for a resource type.

Note Metadata links take priority over naming convention. For details on both options continue reading. Tip Linking templates also applies to Bicep modules when you are using .json parameter files. By metadata # A parameter file can be linked to an associated template or Bicep module by setting metadata. To link a template within a parameter file, set the metadata.template property to the path of the template. PSRule for Azure supports either: Relative to repository \u2014 By default, the path is relative to the root of the repository. Relative to template \u2014 To use a path relative to the parameter file, prefix the path with ./ . Tip Referencing a path outside of the repository is blocked as this could lead to unintended exposure. Relative to repository Relative to parameter file The following example shows linking to a template which is stored within a hierarchical template/ sub-directory. Example { \"$schema\" : \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\" , \"contentVersion\" : \"1.0.0.0\" , \"metadata\" : { \"template\" : \"templates/storage/v1/template.json\" }, \"parameters\" : { } } The following example shows linking to a template that is in the same directory as the parameter file.

This works great to mono-repositories. You can discover all the deployments using a specific template by reading metadata. PSRule for Azure includes the Get-AzRuleTemplateLink cmdlet to list parameter file links. Tip By default, metadata links are not required. By configuring the AZURE_PARAMETER_FILE_METADATA_LINK option to true , this can be enforced. When configured, PSRule for Azure will fail parameter files that do not contain a metadata link. For details on AZURE_PARAMETER_FILE_METADATA_LINK see Configuring expansion . Note Bicep modules can also be expanded from parameter files. Instead of specifing a template path, you can specify the path to a Bicep file. Note You may find while editing a .json parameter file the root metadata property is flagged with a warning. For example Property metadata is not allowed. . This doesn't affect the workings of the parameter file or deployment. If you like a detailed description continue reading Troubleshooting . By naming convention # When metadata links are not set, PSRule will fallback to use a naming convention to link to template files. Example A parameter file named azuredeploy.parameters.json links to the template file named azuredeploy.json . PSRule for Azure supports linking by naming convention when: Parameter files end with .parameters.json linking to ARM templates or Bicep modules. The parameter file prefix matches the file name of the template or Bicep module. For example, azuredeploy.parameters.json links to azuredeploy.json or azuredeploy.bicep . If both an ARM template and Bicep module exist, the template ( .json ) is preferred. For example, azuredeploy.parameters.json chooses azuredeploy.json over azuredeploy.bicep if both exist. Both parameter file and template or Bicep module must be in the same directory.

To link a template within a parameter file, set the metadata.template property to the path of the template. PSRule for Azure supports either: Relative to repository \u2014 By default, the path is relative to the root of the repository. Relative to template \u2014 To use a path relative to the parameter file, prefix the path with ./ . Tip Referencing a path outside of the repository is blocked as this could lead to unintended exposure. Relative to repository Relative to parameter file The following example shows linking to a template which is stored within a hierarchical template/ sub-directory. Example { \"$schema\" : \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\" , \"contentVersion\" : \"1.0.0.0\" , \"metadata\" : { \"template\" : \"templates/storage/v1/template.json\" }, \"parameters\" : { } } The following example shows linking to a template that is in the same directory as the parameter file. Example { \"$schema\" : \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\" , \"contentVersion\" : \"1.0.0.0\" , \"metadata\" : { \"template\" : \"./storage.template.json\" }, \"parameters\" : { } } Additional benefits you get by using metadata links include: You can share a common set of versioned templates across multiple deployments in a repository. This works great to mono-repositories. You can discover all the deployments using a specific template by reading metadata. PSRule for Azure includes the Get-AzRuleTemplateLink cmdlet to list parameter file links. Tip By default, metadata links are not required. By configuring the AZURE_PARAMETER_FILE_METADATA_LINK option to true , this can be enforced. When configured, PSRule for Azure will fail parameter files that do not contain a metadata link. For details on AZURE_PARAMETER_FILE_METADATA_LINK see Configuring expansion . Note Bicep modules can also be expanded from parameter files. Instead of specifing a template path, you can specify the path to a Bicep file. Note You may find while editing a .json parameter file the root metadata property is flagged with a warning. For example Property metadata is not allowed. . This doesn't affect the workings of the parameter file or deployment. If you like a detailed description continue reading Troubleshooting .","title":"By metadata"},{"location":"using-templates/#by-naming-convention","text":"When metadata links are not set, PSRule will fallback to use a naming convention to link to template files. Example A parameter file named azuredeploy.parameters.json links to the template file named azuredeploy.json . PSRule for Azure supports linking by naming convention when: Parameter files end with .parameters.json linking to ARM templates or Bicep modules. The parameter file prefix matches the file name of the template or Bicep module. For example, azuredeploy.parameters.json links to azuredeploy.json or azuredeploy.bicep . If both an ARM template and Bicep module exist, the template ( .json ) is preferred. For example, azuredeploy.parameters.json chooses azuredeploy.json over azuredeploy.bicep if both exist.

Template and parameters are merged by resolving template parameters, variables and functions. This function does not check template files for strict compliance with Azure schemas. By default this is an offline process, requiring no connectivity to Azure. Some functions that may be included in templates dynamically query Azure for current state. For these functions standard placeholder values are used by default. Functions that use placeholders include reference , list* . The subscription() function will return the following unless overridden: subscriptionId: 'ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff' tenantId: 'ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff' displayName: 'PSRule Test Subscription' state: 'NotDefined' The resourceGroup() function will return the following unless overridden: name: 'ps-rule-test-rg' location: 'eastus' tags: { } properties: provisioningState: 'Succeeded' To override, set the AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION and AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP in configuration. Currently the following limitations apply: Nested templates are expanded, external templates are not. Deployment resources that link to an external template are returned as a resource. Sub-resources such as diagnostic logs or configurations are automatically nested. Automatic nesting a sub-resource requires: The parent resource is defined in the same template. The sub-resource depends on the parent resource. The environment template function always returns values for Azure public cloud. References to Key Vault secrets are not expanded. A placeholder value is used instead. The reference() function will return objects for resources within the same template. For resources that are not in the same template, a placeholder value is used instead. Multi-line strings are not supported. Template expressions up to a maximum of 100,000 characters are supported.

Description # By default, Azure automatically replicates the operating system disk for a virtual machine to Azure storage to avoid data loss if the VM needs to be relocated to another host. However, since containers aren't designed to have local state persisted, this behavior offers limited value while providing some drawbacks, including slower node provisioning and higher read/write latency.

NB: When a user does not explicitly request managed disks for the OS, AKS will default to ephemeral OS if possible for a given node pool configuration. The rule is therefore configured with -Level Warning as it can give inaccurate information. When using ephemeral OS, the OS disk must fit in the VM cache. The sizes for VM cache are available in the Azure documentation in parentheses next to IO throughput (\"cache size in GiB\"). Examples: Using the AKS default VM size Standard_DS2_v2 with the default OS disk size of 100GB as an example, this VM size supports ephemeral OS but only has 86GB of cache size. This configuration would default to managed disks if the user does not specify explicitly. If a user explicitly requested ephemeral OS, they would receive a validation error. If a user requests the same Standard_DS2_v2 with a 60GB OS disk, this configuration would default to ephemeral OS: the requested size of 60GB is smaller than the maximum cache size of 86GB.

Examples: Using the AKS default VM size Standard_DS2_v2 with the default OS disk size of 100GB as an example, this VM size supports ephemeral OS but only has 86GB of cache size. This configuration would default to managed disks if the user does not specify explicitly. If a user explicitly requested ephemeral OS, they would receive a validation error. If a user requests the same Standard_DS2_v2 with a 60GB OS disk, this configuration would default to ephemeral OS: the requested size of 60GB is smaller than the maximum cache size of 86GB.","title":"Description"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.AKS.EphemeralOSDisk/#recommendation","text":"AKS clusters should use ephemeral OS disks.","title":"Recommendation"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.AKS.EphemeralOSDisk/#examples","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.AKS.EphemeralOSDisk/#configure-with-azure-template","text":"To deploy an AKS cluster that pass this rule: Set properties.agentPoolProfiles.osDiskType to Ephemeral .

To avoid service disruption, migrate to App Service Environment version 3 (ASEv3). App Service Environment v3 has advantages and feature differences that provide enhanced support for your workloads and can reduce overall costs. App Service Environment v3 differs from earlier versions in the following ways: There are no networking dependencies on the customer's virtual network. You can secure all inbound and outbound traffic and route outbound traffic as you want. You can deploy an App Service Environment v3 that's enabled for zone redundancy. You set zone redundancy only during creation and only in regions where all App Service Environment v3 dependencies are zone redundant. In this case, each App Service Plan on the App Service Environment will need to have a minimum of three instances so that they can be spread across zones. For more information, see Migrate App Service Environment to availability zone support. You can deploy an App Service Environment v3 on a dedicated host group. Host group deployments aren't zone redundant. Scaling is much faster than with an App Service Environment v2. Although scaling still isn't immediate, as in the multi-tenant service, it's a lot faster. Front-end scaling adjustments are no longer required. App Service Environment v3 front ends automatically scale to meet your needs and are deployed on better hosts. Scaling no longer blocks other scale operations within the App Service Environment v3. Only one scale operation can be in effect for a combination of OS and size. For example, while your Windows small App Service plan is scaling, you could kick off a scale operation to run at the same time on a Windows medium or anything else other than Windows small. You can reach apps in an internal-VIP App Service Environment v3 across global peering. Such access wasn't possible in earlier versions. A few features that were available in earlier versions of App Service Environment aren't available in App Service Environment v3. For example, you can no longer do the following: Monitor your traffic with Network Watcher or network security group (NSG) flow logs.

Description # Azure Front Door delivers large files without a cap on file size. Front Door uses a technique called object chunking. When a large file is requested, Front Door retrieves smaller pieces of the file from the backend. After receiving a full or byte-range file request, the Front Door environment requests the file from the backend in chunks of 8 MB. After the chunk arrives at the Front Door environment, it's cached and immediately served to the user. Front Door then pre-fetches the next chunk in parallel. This pre-fetch ensures that the content stays one chunk ahead of the user, which reduces latency. This process continues until the entire file gets downloaded (if requested) or the client closes the connection. For more information on the byte-range request, read RFC 7233. Front Door caches any chunks as they're received so the entire file doesn't need to be cached on the Front Door cache. Ensuing requests for the file or byte ranges are served from the cache. If the chunks aren't all cached, pre-fetching is used to request chunks from the backend. This optimization relies on the backend's ability to support byte-range requests.

Description # Network Security Groups (NSGs) are basic stateful firewalls that provide network isolation and security. NSGs allow or deny network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. i.e. Traffic between VMs on the same or different subnet can be restricted. NSGs do this by enforcing ordered access rules for all traffic in or out services attached to a subnet. This micro-segmentation approach provides a control to reduce lateral movement between services. Typically, a subset of trusted hosts such as privileged access workstations (PAWs), bastion hosts, or jump boxes will be used for management. Management protocols originating from application workload hosts should be blocked. For example: An SQL Server should not be used as a management host to manage other SQL Servers, or File Servers. Configure dedicated management hosts to manage other hosts. This helps improve security in two ways: Reduces the attack surface that can be used in lateral traversal attacks.

An Azure Bastion host is deployed inside an Azure Virtual Network and can access virtual machines in the virtual network (VNet), or virtual machines in peered VNets. Azure Bastion is a fully managed service that provides more secure and seamless Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) access to virtual machines (VMs), without any exposure through public IP addresses. This is a recommended pattern for virtual machine remote access. Adding Azure Bastion in your configuration adds the following benefits: Added resiliency (out of band remote access). Negates the need for hybrid connectivity. Provides an extra layer of control.

Una opci\u00f3n para escanear im\u00e1genes de contenedores es usar Microsoft Defender para registros de contenedores. Microsoft Defender para registros de contenedores analiza cada imagen de contenedor enviada al registro. Microsoft Defender para registros de contenedores analiza im\u00e1genes en im\u00e1genes insertadas, importadas y extra\u00eddas recientemente.

ARM templates are typically not static, they include parameters, functions and conditions. Depending on the parameters provided to a template, resources may differ significantly. Important resource properties that should be validated are often variables, parameters or deployed conditionally. Under these circumstances, to correctly validate resources in a template, parameters must be resolved. The following scenario shows how PSRule can be used to validate Azure resource templates within an Azure Pipeline. This scenario covers the following: Installing PSRule extension Linking parameter files to templates Creating a YAML pipeline Installing Azure rules Exporting resource data for analysis Validating exported resources Generating NUnit output Complete example Installing PSRule extension # PSRule includes an extension that can be installed from the Visual Studio Marketplace . Once installed, Azure Pipelines tasks are available to install PSRule modules and run analysis. Linking parameter files to templates # ARM template parameter files allows parameters for a deployment to be saved and checked into source control. PSRule can automatically resolve ARM templates from parameter files by using a metadata link. To link a parameter file to an ARM template add the metadata.template property within a parameter file. For example: { \"$schema\" : \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\" , \"contentVersion\" : \"1.0.0.0\" , \"metadata\" : { \"template\" : \"./azuredeploy.json\" }, \"parameters\" : { \"vnetName\" : { \"value\" : \"vnet-001\" }, \"addressPrefix\" : { \"value\" : [ \"10.1.0.0/24\" ] } } } In the example parameter file azuredeploy.parameters.json is linked to the template azuredeploy.json . The prefix of ./ indicates that the template file is in a relative path to the parameter file. If ./ is not included, PSRule will look for the template relative to the working directory. For example: { \"$schema\" : \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\" , \"contentVersion\" : \"1.0.0.0\" , \"metadata\" : { \"template\" : \"templates/vnet-hub/v1/template.json\" }, \"parameters\" : { \"vnetName\" : { \"value\" : \"vnet-001\" }, \"addressPrefix\" : { \"value\" : [ \"10.1.0.0/24\" ] } } } Creating a YAML pipeline # Azure Pipelines supports defining pipelines in YAML. PSRule uses a number of configurable task steps to install modules, export data and perform analysis. Installing Azure rules # To install the module containing Azure rules use the ps-rule-install YAML task. # Install PSRule.Rules.Azure from the PowerShell Gallery. - task : ps-rule-install@2 inputs : module : PSRule.Rules.Azure # Install PSRule.Rules.Azure from the PowerShell Gallery. Exporting resource data for analysis # PSRule provides a pre-built cmdlets for finding template files within a path and exporting resource data. Get-AzRuleTemplateLink finds linked templates from parameter files. By default, parameter files with the *.parameters.json extension are discovered. Files are found recursively from the current working path. Export-AzRuleTemplateData exports resource data from template files. To generate data for analysis use a PowerShell YAML task to export resource data from linked templates. # Export resource data from parameter files within the current working directory. - powershell : Get-AzRuleTemplateLink | Export-AzRuleTemplateData -OutputPath out/templates/; displayName : 'Export template data' If parameter files are located in a specific sub-directory the path can be updated as follows. # Export resource data from parameter files in the deployments/ sub-directory. - powershell : Get-AzRuleTemplateLink ./deployments/ | Export-AzRuleTemplateData -OutputPath out/templates/; displayName : 'Export template data' If parameter files do not use the file extension .parameters.json input path can be set. # Export resource data from parameter files ending in *.json instead of default *.parameters.json. - powershell : Get-AzRuleTemplateLink -InputPath *.json | Export-AzRuleTemplateData -OutputPath out/templates/; displayName : 'Export template data' In both cases, resource data for analysis is exported to out/templates/ . Validating exported resources # To validate exported resources use the ps-rule-assert YAML task.

PSRule PowerShell modules need to be installed prior to calling PSRule cmdlets. If your CI pipeline runs on a persistent virtual machine that you control, consider pre-installing PSRule. The following examples focus on installing PSRule dynamically during execution of the pipeline. Which is suitable for cloud-based CI worker nodes. To install PSRule within a CI pipeline, execute the Install-Module PowerShell cmdlet. Depending on your environment, the CI worker process may not have administrative permissions. To install modules into the current context running the CI pipeline use -Scope CurrentUser . The PowerShell Gallery is not a trusted source by default. Use the -Force switch to suppress a prompt to install modules from PowerShell Gallery. For example: $Null = Install-Module -Name PSRule . Rules . Azure -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; Installing PSRule.Rules.Azure also installs the base PSRule module and associated Azure dependencies. The PSRule.Rules.Azure module includes cmdlets and pre-built rules for validating Azure resources. Using the pre-built rules is completely optional. In some cases, installing NuGet and PowerShellGet may be required to connect to the PowerShell Gallery. The NuGet package provider can be installed using the Install-PackageProvider PowerShell cmdlet. $Null = Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; The example below includes both steps together with checks: if ( $Null -eq ( Get-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue )) { $Null = Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; } if ( $Null -eq ( Get-InstalledModule -Name PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2 . 2 . 1 -ErrorAction Ignore )) { Install-Module PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2 . 2 . 1 -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber ; } if ( $Null -eq ( Get-InstalledModule -Name PSRule . Rules . Azure -MinimumVersion '0.12.1' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue )) { $Null = Install-Module -Name PSRule . Rules . Azure -Scope CurrentUser -MinimumVersion '0.12.1' -Force ; } Add -AllowPrerelease to install pre-release versions. See the change log for the latest version. Exporting rule data for analysis # In PSRule, the Export-AzRuleTemplateData cmdlet resolves a template and returns a resultant set of resources. The resultant set of resources can then be validated. No connectivity to Azure is required by default when calling Export-AzRuleTemplateData . Export cmdlet parameters # To run Export-AzRuleTemplateData two key parameters are required: -TemplateFile - An absolute or relative path to the template JSON file. -ParameterFile - An absolute or relative path to one or more parameter JSON files. The -ParameterFile parameter is optional when all parameters defined in the template have defaultValue set. Optionally the following parameters can be used: -Name - The name of the deployment. If not specified a default name of export-<xxxxxxxx> will be used. -OutputPath - An absolute or relative path where the resultant resources will be written to JSON. If not specified the current working path be used. -ResourceGroup - The name of a resource group where the deployment is intended to be run. If not specified placeholder values will be used. -Subscription - The name or subscription Id of a subscription where the deployment is intended to be run. If not specified placeholder values will be used. See cmdlet help for a full list of parameters. If -OutputPath is a directory or is not set, the output file will be automatically named resources-<name>.json . For example: Export-AzRuleTemplateData -TemplateFile .\\ template . json -ParameterFile .\\ parameters . json ; Multiple parameter files that map to the same template can be supplied in a single cmdlet call. Additional templates can be exported by calling Export-AzRuleTemplateData multiple times. Use of placeholder values # A number of functions that can be used within Azure templates retrieve information from Azure. Some examples include reference , subscription , resourceGroup , list* . The default for Export-AzRuleTemplateData is to operate without requiring authenticated connectivity to Azure. As a result, functions that retrieve information from Azure use placeholders such as {{Subscription.SubscriptionId}} . To provide a real value for subscription and resourceGroup use the -Subscription and -ResourceGroup parameters. When using -Subscription and -ResourceGroup the subscription and resource group must already exist. Additionally the context running the cmdlet must have at least read access (i.e. Reader ). It is currently not possible to provide a real value for reference and list* , only placeholders will be used. Key Vault references in parameter files use placeholders instead of the real value to prevent accidental exposure of secrets. Validating exported resources # To validate exported resources use Invoke-PSRule , Assert-PSRule or Test-PSRuleTarget . In a CI pipeline, Assert-PSRule is recommended. Assert-PSRule outputs preformatted results ideal for use within a CI pipeline. Use Assert-PSRule with the resolved resource output as an input using -InputPath . In the following example, resources from .\\resources.json are validated against pre-built rules: Assert-PSRule -InputPath .\\ resources-export -*. json -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure ; Example output: -> vnet-001 : Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks [PASS] Azure.Resource.UseTags [PASS] Azure.VirtualNetwork.UseNSGs [PASS] Azure.VirtualNetwork.SingleDNS [PASS] Azure.VirtualNetwork.LocalDNS -> vnet-001/subnet2 : Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets [FAIL] Azure.Resource.UseTags To process multiple input files a wildcard * can be used. Assert-PSRule -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure ; Formatting output # When executing a CI pipeline, feedback on any validation failures is important. The Assert-PSRule cmdlet provides easy to read formatted output instead of PowerShell objects. Additionally, Assert-PSRule supports styling formatted output for Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions. Use the -Style AzurePipelines or -Style GitHubActions parameter to style output. For example: Assert-PSRule -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json -Style AzurePipelines -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure ; Failing the pipeline # When using PSRule within a CI pipeline, a failed rule should stop the pipeline. When using Assert-PSRule if any rules fail, an error will be generated. Assert-PSRule : One or more rules reported failure. At line:1 char:1 + Assert-PSRule -Module PSRule.Rules.Azure -InputPath .\\out\\tests\\Resou ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : InvalidData: (:) [Assert-PSRule], FailPipelineException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PSRule.Fail,Assert-PSRule A single PowerShell error is typically enough to stop a CI pipeline. If you are using a different configuration additionally -ErrorAction Stop can be used. For example: Assert-PSRule -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json -ErrorAction Stop ; Generating NUnit output # NUnit is a popular unit test framework for .NET. NUnit generates a test report format that is widely interpreted by CI systems. While PSRule does not use NUnit directly, it support outputting validation results in the NUnit3 format. Using a common format allows integration with any system that supports the NUnit3 for publishing test results. To generate an NUnit report: Use the -OutputFormat NUnit3 parameter. Use the -OutputPath parameter to specify the path of the report file to write. Assert-PSRule -OutputFormat NUnit3 -OutputPath .\\ reports \\ rule-report . xml -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json ; The output path will be created if it does not exist. Complete example # Putting each of these steps together.

Within Invoke-Build, each build process is broken into tasks. The following example shows an example of using PSRule.Rules.Azure with InvokeBuild tasks. # Synopsis: Install PSRule modules task InstallPSRule { if ( $Null -eq ( Get-InstalledModule -Name PSRule .

Typically, Pester unit tests are built for a particular pipeline. PSRule can complement Pester unit tests by providing dynamic and sharable rules that are easy to reuse. By using -If or -Type pre-conditions, rules can dynamically provide validation for a range of use cases. When calling PSRule from Pester use Invoke-PSRule instead of Assert-PSRule . Invoke-PSRule returns validation result objects that can be tested by Pester Should conditions. Additionally, the Logging.RuleFail option can be included to generate an error message for each failing rule. For example: Describe 'Azure' { Context 'Resource templates' { It 'Use content rules' { Export-AzRuleTemplateData -TemplateFile .\\ template . json -ParameterFile .\\ parameters . json -OutputPath .\\ out \\ resources . json ; # Validate resources $invokeParams = @{ InputPath = 'out/*.json' Module = 'PSRule.Rules.Azure' OutputFormat = 'NUnit3' OutputPath = 'reports/rule-report.xml' Option = ( New-PSRuleOption -LoggingRuleFail Error ) } Invoke-PSRule @invokeParams -Outcome Fail , Error | Should -BeNullOrEmpty ; } } } More information # pipeline-deps.ps1 - Example script installing pipeline dependencies. validate-template.ps1 - Example script for running template validation. template.json - Example template file. parameters.json - Example parameters file.","title":"Validate Azure resources from templates with continuous integration (CI)"},{"location":"scenarios/azure-template-ci/azure-template-ci/#validate-azure-resources-from-templates-with-continuous-integration-ci","text":"Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are a JSON-based file structure.
