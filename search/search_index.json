PSRule for Azure provides several baselines that can be referenced when running PSRule. Quarterly baselines provide a stable checkpoint of rules when you need to stagger adoption of new rules. Continue reading working with baselines for a detailed breakdown. Is Terraform supported? # Currently PSRule for Azure supports testing Azure resources from Infrastructure as Code ( IaC ) with: Azure Resource Manager ( ARM ) templates. Azure Bicep deployments. Checking Terraform from HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is not supported at this time. If this feature is important to you, please upvote \ud83d\udc4d the issue on GitHub. What is supported? After resources are deployed to Azure, PSRule for Azure can be used to check the Azure resources in-flight . This methods works for Azure resources regardless of how they are deployed. Use this method for analyzing resources deployed via the Azure Portal, Terraform, Pulumi, or other tools. For instructions on how to do this see Exporting rule data . What methods are supported for checking resources? # PSRule for Azure supports two methods for analyzing Azure resources: Pre-flight \u2014 Before resources are deployed from an ARM template or Bicep. Use pre-flight analysis to: Implement checks within Pull Requests ( PRs ). Improve alignment of resources to WAF recommendations. Identify issues that prevent successful resource deployments on Azure. Integrate continual improvement and standardization of Azure resource configurations.

Use in-flight analysis to: Implement release gates between environments for non-native tools such as Terraform. Performing offline analysis in split-environments. For more information see Exporting rule data . How do I create a custom rule to enforce resource group tagging? # PSRule for Azure covers common use cases that align to the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework . Use of resource and resource group tags is recommended in the WAF , however implementation may vary. You may want to use PSRule to enforce tagging or something similar early in a DevOps pipeline. We have a walk through scenario Enforcing custom tags to get you started. How do I create a custom rule to enforce code ownership? # GitHub, Azure DevOps, and other DevOps platforms may implement code ownership. This process involves assigning a team or an individual review and approval responsibility. In GitHub or Azure DevOps implementation, ownership is linked to the file path. When a repository contains resources that different teams would approve how do you: Ensure resources are created in a path that triggers the correct approval? We have a walk through scenario Enforcing code ownership to get you started. Do you have sample code? # In addition to the walk through scenarios, we have a quick start template here . The repository contains sample ARM templates, Bicep, and pipeline code to get you started. In GitHub you can simply use the repository as a template for your own project. Do I need PowerShell experience to start using PSRule for Azure? # No. You can start using built-in rules and CI with Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions. If we didn't tell you, you might not even know that PowerShell runs under the covers. To perform local validation, some PowerShell setup is required but we step you through that. See installation and validating locally for details. To start writing your own custom rules you can use YAML, JSON, or PowerShell. PowerShell experience is required for some scenarios.

Providing the ability to analyze resources in Azure Resource Manager templates before deployment. Additionally, analysis can be performed in a CI process. Providing the ability to layer on organization specific rules, as required. Data collection requires limited permissions and requires no additional configuration. What do the different severity and levels for rules means? # PSRule for Azure annotates rules with three (3) severities which indicate how you should prioritize remediation. The following severities are defined: Critical \u2014 Consider addressing these first, ideally within the next thirty (30) days. Rules identified as critical often have high impact and are highly likely to affect your services. Important \u2014 Consider addressing these next, ideally within the next sixty (60) days. Rules identified as important often have a significant impact and are likely to affect your services. Awareness \u2014 Consider addressing these last, ideally within the next ninty (90) days. Rules identified as awareness often have a moderate or low impact to the operation of your services. Tip Severities and suggested time frames are an indicator only. They may affect your environment, compliance, or security differently based on your specific requirements. If you feel the severity for a rule is broadly incorrect then please let as know. You can do this by joining or starting a discussion . Additionally, PSRule for Azure uses three (3) rule levels. These levels determine how PSRule provides feedback about failing cases. The following levels are defined: Error \u2014 Rules defined as error will stop CI pipelines that are configured to break on error. Warning \u2014 Rules defined as warning will not stop CI pipelines and will produce a warning. Information \u2014 Rules defined as information will not stop CI pipelines.

This can be caused by errors or warnings. Check the Bicep output by running bicep build and addressing any issues. This error is raised when Bicep takes longer then the timeout to build a source file. The default timeout is 5 seconds. You can take steps to reduce your code complexity and reduce the time a build takes by: Removing unnecessary nested module calls. Cache bicep modules restored from a registry in continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To increase the timeout value, set the AZURE_BICEP_FILE_EXPANSION_TIMEOUT configuration option. See Bicep compilation timeout for details on how to configure this option. No rules or no Azure resources are found # There is a few common causes of this issue including: Check input format \u2014 PSRule for Azure must discover files to expand them. When running PSRule for Azure using GitHub Actions or the Azure Pipelines extension: Your pipeline must be set to inputType: repository , which is the default value. PSRule for Azure will not work with inputType set to inputPath . You may have set this parameter because you wanted to use the inputPath parameter. Setting the inputType is not a requirement for using the inputPath parameter. The inputPath parameter can be used independently. When running PSRule for Azure from PowerShell: Your command-line must use the -Format File parameter. Your command-line must use the -InputPath or -f parameter followed by a file or directory path. For example: Assert-PSRule -Module PSRule.Rules.Azure -Format File -f 'modules/' . Check expansion is enabled \u2014 Expansion must be enabled to analyze Azure Infrastructure as Code. See using templates and using Bicep source for details on how to enable expansion. Check parameter files are linked \u2014 Parameter files must be linked to ARM templates or Bicep source files. See using templates for details on how to link using metadata or naming convention. Note If your pipeline is still not finding any Azure resources, please join or start a discussion . Custom rules are not running # There is a few common causes of this issue including: Check rule path \u2014 By default, PSRule will look for rules in the .ps-rule/ directory. This directory is the root for your repository or the current working path by default. On case-sensitive file systems such as Linux, this directory name is case-sensitive. See Storing and naming rules for more information. Check file name suffix \u2014 PSRule only looks for files with the .Rule.ps1 , .Rule.yaml , or .Rule.jsonc suffix. On case-sensitive file systems such as Linux, this file siffix is case-sensitive. See Storing and naming rules for more information. Check binding configuration \u2014 PSRule uses binding to work out which property to use for a resource type. To be able to use the -Type parameter or type properties in rules definitions, binding must be set. This is automatically configured for PSRule for Azure, however must be set in ps-rule.yaml for custom rules. See binding type for more information. Check modules \u2014 PSRule for Azure is responsible for expanding Azure resources from Infrastructure as Code. Expansion occurs automatically in memory when enabled. For this to work, the module PSRule.Rules.Azure must be run with any custom rules. See using templates and using Bicep source for details on how to enable expansion. Tip You may be able to use git mv to change the case of a file if it is commited to the repository inorrectly. Parameter file warns of metadata property # You may find while editing a .json parameter file the root metadata property is flagged with a warning. Warning The property 'metadata' is not allowed.

New quarterly baselines are released every three (3) months. Baselines are named Azure.GA_yyyy_mm and Azure.Preview_yyyy_mm based on the release year/ month. Incremental adoption \u2014 It may not be possibly to implement new rules immediately. Existing backlogs or timelines may make it impossible to add new requirements until a future sprint. In a future sprint, bump the quarterly baseline to the latest release to get the additional rules. Considerations for adopting a quarterly baseline include: The quarterly baselines older than the latest are flagged as obsolete. Obsolete baselines can still be used, however will generate a warning. As Azure evolves there may be cases where a feature change means a rule is no longer required. In these cases, a rule may be removed from PSRule for Azure and any applicable baselines. Separate quarterly baselines for Azure GA and preview features are provided. The baseline for GA features is named Azure.GA_yyyy_mm and preview features is named Azure.Preview_yyyy_mm . Important When using a quarterly baseline, by default PSRule will ignore custom/ standalone rules. To include custom rules, set the Rule.IncludeLocal option to true . This is described further in including custom rules . Note The preview quarterly baselines includes Azure features relased under preview only. This is different from the Azure.Preview baseline which contains GA and preview features. Limitations # Quarterly baselines don't address all cases where a previously passing pipeline may fail, specifically: As bugs are identified they are corrected and shipped in the next minor or patch release. If the rule was not correctly working previously, failures may be generated after the fix. To workaround this you can either: Create a temporary suppression to ignore the issue. Install a previous version of the PSRule for Azure module. Rule configuration defaults change. Currently rule configuration defaults are not included in quarterly baselines. To workaround this, override the rule configuration option by setting the value in ps-rule.yaml .

Incremental adoption \u2014 It may not be possibly to implement new rules immediately. Existing backlogs or timelines may make it impossible to add new requirements until a future sprint. In a future sprint, bump the quarterly baseline to the latest release to get the additional rules. Considerations for adopting a quarterly baseline include: The quarterly baselines older than the latest are flagged as obsolete. Obsolete baselines can still be used, however will generate a warning. As Azure evolves there may be cases where a feature change means a rule is no longer required. In these cases, a rule may be removed from PSRule for Azure and any applicable baselines. Separate quarterly baselines for Azure GA and preview features are provided. The baseline for GA features is named Azure.GA_yyyy_mm and preview features is named Azure.Preview_yyyy_mm . Important When using a quarterly baseline, by default PSRule will ignore custom/ standalone rules. To include custom rules, set the Rule.IncludeLocal option to true . This is described further in including custom rules . Note The preview quarterly baselines includes Azure features relased under preview only. This is different from the Azure.Preview baseline which contains GA and preview features.","title":"Quarterly baselines"},{"location":"working-with-baselines/#limitations","text":"Quarterly baselines don't address all cases where a previously passing pipeline may fail, specifically: As bugs are identified they are corrected and shipped in the next minor or patch release. If the rule was not correctly working previously, failures may be generated after the fix. To workaround this you can either: Create a temporary suppression to ignore the issue. Install a previous version of the PSRule for Azure module. Rule configuration defaults change. Currently rule configuration defaults are not included in quarterly baselines.

Microsoft Defender for container registries scans images on push, import, and recently pulled images. Recently pulled images are scanned on a regular basis when they have been pulled within the last 30 days. When scanned, the container image is pulled and executed in an isolated sandbox for scanning. Any detected vulnerabilities are reported to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Container image vulnerability scanning with Microsoft Defender for container registries: Is currently only available for Linux-hosted ACR registries. The container registry must be accessible by Microsoft Defender for Container registries. Network access can not be restricted by firewall, Service Endpoints, or Private Endpoints. Is supported in commercial clouds. Is not currently supported in sovereign or national clouds (e.g. US Gov, China Gov, etc.).","title":"Description"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.ACR.ContainerScan/#recommendation","text":"Consider using Microsoft Defender for Cloud to scan for security vulnerabilities in container images.","title":"Recommendation"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.ACR.ContainerScan/#examples","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.ACR.ContainerScan/#configure-with-azure-template","text":"To enable container image scanning: Set the Standard pricing tier for Microsoft Defender for container registries.

Description # The classic App Service Environment version 1 (ASEv1) and version 2 (ASEv2) will be retired on August 31, 2024. To avoid service disruption, migrate to App Service Environment version 3 (ASEv3). App Service Environment v3 has advantages and feature differences that provide enhanced support for your workloads and can reduce overall costs. App Service Environment v3 differs from earlier versions in the following ways: There are no networking dependencies on the customer's virtual network. You can secure all inbound and outbound traffic and route outbound traffic as you want. You can deploy an App Service Environment v3 that's enabled for zone redundancy. You set zone redundancy only during creation and only in regions where all App Service Environment v3 dependencies are zone redundant. In this case, each App Service Plan on the App Service Environment will need to have a minimum of three instances so that they can be spread across zones. For more information, see Migrate App Service Environment to availability zone support. You can deploy an App Service Environment v3 on a dedicated host group. Host group deployments aren't zone redundant. Scaling is much faster than with an App Service Environment v2. Although scaling still isn't immediate, as in the multi-tenant service, it's a lot faster. Front-end scaling adjustments are no longer required. App Service Environment v3 front ends automatically scale to meet your needs and are deployed on better hosts. Scaling no longer blocks other scale operations within the App Service Environment v3. Only one scale operation can be in effect for a combination of OS and size. For example, while your Windows small App Service plan is scaling, you could kick off a scale operation to run at the same time on a Windows medium or anything else other than Windows small. You can reach apps in an internal-VIP App Service Environment v3 across global peering. Such access wasn't possible in earlier versions. A few features that were available in earlier versions of App Service Environment aren't available in App Service Environment v3. For example, you can no longer do the following: Monitor your traffic with Network Watcher or network security group (NSG) flow logs.

To avoid service disruption, migrate to App Service Environment version 3 (ASEv3). App Service Environment v3 has advantages and feature differences that provide enhanced support for your workloads and can reduce overall costs. App Service Environment v3 differs from earlier versions in the following ways: There are no networking dependencies on the customer's virtual network. You can secure all inbound and outbound traffic and route outbound traffic as you want. You can deploy an App Service Environment v3 that's enabled for zone redundancy. You set zone redundancy only during creation and only in regions where all App Service Environment v3 dependencies are zone redundant. In this case, each App Service Plan on the App Service Environment will need to have a minimum of three instances so that they can be spread across zones. For more information, see Migrate App Service Environment to availability zone support. You can deploy an App Service Environment v3 on a dedicated host group. Host group deployments aren't zone redundant. Scaling is much faster than with an App Service Environment v2. Although scaling still isn't immediate, as in the multi-tenant service, it's a lot faster. Front-end scaling adjustments are no longer required. App Service Environment v3 front ends automatically scale to meet your needs and are deployed on better hosts. Scaling no longer blocks other scale operations within the App Service Environment v3. Only one scale operation can be in effect for a combination of OS and size. For example, while your Windows small App Service plan is scaling, you could kick off a scale operation to run at the same time on a Windows medium or anything else other than Windows small. You can reach apps in an internal-VIP App Service Environment v3 across global peering. Such access wasn't possible in earlier versions. A few features that were available in earlier versions of App Service Environment aren't available in App Service Environment v3. For example, you can no longer do the following: Monitor your traffic with Network Watcher or network security group (NSG) flow logs.

Health probes allow Front Door to select a backend endpoint able to respond to the request.","title":"Description"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.Probe/#recommendation","text":"Consider enabling a health probe for each Front Door backend endpoint.","title":"Recommendation"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.Probe/#examples","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.Probe/#configure-with-azure-cli","text":"Azure CLI snippet az network front-door probe update --front-door-name '<front_door>' -n '<probe_name>' -g '<resource_group>' --enabled 'Enabled'","title":"Configure with Azure CLI"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.Probe/#configure-with-azure-powershell","text":"Azure PowerShell snippet $probeSetting = New-AzFrontDoorHealthProbeSettingObject -Name '<probe_name>' -EnabledState 'Enabled' Set-AzFrontDoor -Name '<front_door>' -ResourceGroupName '<resource_group>' -HealthProbeSetting $probeSetting","title":"Configure with Azure PowerShell"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.Probe/#configure-with-azure-powershell_1","text":"Azure PowerShell snippet $probeSetting = New-AzFrontDoorHealthProbeSettingObject -Name '<probe_name>' -Path '<path>' Set-AzFrontDoor -Name '<front_door>' -ResourceGroupName '<resource_group>' -HealthProbeSetting $probeSetting","title":"Configure with Azure PowerShell"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.Probe/#configure-with-azure-template","text":"To deploy a Front Door resource that passes this rule: Configure the healthProbeSettings on the OriginGroup For example: Azure Template snippet \"resources\" : [ { \"type\" : \"Microsoft.Cdn/profiles\" , \"apiVersion\" : \"2021-06-01\" , \"name\" : \"[parameters('frontDoorName')]\" , \"location\" : \"Global\" , \"sku\" : { \"name\" : \"Standard_AzureFrontDoor\" } }, { \"type\" : \"Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/afdEndpoints\" , \"apiVersion\" : \"2021-06-01\" , \"name\" : \"[format('{0}/{1}', parameters('frontDoorName'), variables('frontDoorEndpointName'))]\" , \"location\" : \"Global\" , \"properties\" : { \"enabledState\" : \"Enabled\" }, \"dependsOn\" : [ \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Cdn/profiles', parameters('frontDoorName'))]\" ] }, { \"type\" : \"Microsoft.Cdn/profiles/originGroups\" , \"apiVersion\" : \"2021-06-01\" , \"name\" : \"[format('{0}/{1}', parameters('frontDoorName'), variables('frontDoorDefaultOriginGroupName'))]\" , \"properties\" : { \"loadBalancingSettings\" : { \"sampleSize\" : 4 , \"successfulSamplesRequired\" : 3 }, \"healthProbeSettings\" : { \"probePath\" : \"/\" , \"probeRequestType\" : \"HEAD\" , \"probeProtocol\" : \"Http\" , \"probeIntervalInSeconds\" : 100 } }, \"dependsOn\" : [ \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Cdn/profiles', parameters('frontDoorName'))]\" ] } ] ``` ### Co nf igure wi t h Bicep To deploy a Fro nt Door resource t ha t passes t his rule : - Co nf igure t he heal t hProbeSe tt i n gs o n t he Origi n Group For example : ```bicep t i tle = \"Azure Bicep snippet\" resource fr o nt DoorResource 'Microso ft .Cd n /pro f iles@ 2021-06-01 ' = { na me : fr o nt DoorName loca t io n : 'Global' sku : { na me : 'S tan dard_AzureFro nt Door' } } resource fr o nt DoorE n dpoi nt 'Microso ft .Cd n /pro f iles/a f de n dpoi nts @ 2021-06-01 ' = { pare nt : fr o nt DoorResource na me : fr o nt DoorE n dpoi nt Name loca t io n : 'Global' proper t ies : { e na bledS tate : 'E na bled' } } resource fr o nt DoorOrigi n Group 'Microso ft .Cd n /pro f iles/origi n groups@ 2021-06-01 ' = { na me : fr o nt DoorDe fault Origi n GroupName pare nt : fr o nt DoorResource proper t ies : { loadBala n ci n gSe tt i n gs : { sampleSize : 4 success ful SamplesRequired : 3 } heal t hProbeSe tt i n gs : { probePa t h : '/' probeReques t Type : 'HEAD' probePro t ocol : 'H tt p' probeI nter valI n Seco n ds : 100 } } }","title":"Configure with Azure template"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.Probe/#links","text":"Creating good health probes Health probes How Front Door determines backend health Health Endpoint Monitoring pattern Azure resource template","title":"Links"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.ProbeMethod/","tags":["Azure.FrontDoor.ProbeMethod","AZR-000109"],"text":"Use HEAD health probes for Front Door backends # Azure.FrontDoor.ProbeMethod AZR-000109 Error Reliability \u00b7 Front Door \u00b7 2021_03 Configure health probes to use HEAD instead of GET requests.

Description # Azure Front Door delivers large files without a cap on file size. Front Door uses a technique called object chunking. When a large file is requested, Front Door retrieves smaller pieces of the file from the backend. After receiving a full or byte-range file request, the Front Door environment requests the file from the backend in chunks of 8 MB. After the chunk arrives at the Front Door environment, it's cached and immediately served to the user. Front Door then pre-fetches the next chunk in parallel. This pre-fetch ensures that the content stays one chunk ahead of the user, which reduces latency. This process continues until the entire file gets downloaded (if requested) or the client closes the connection. For more information on the byte-range request, read RFC 7233. Front Door caches any chunks as they're received so the entire file doesn't need to be cached on the Front Door cache. Ensuing requests for the file or byte ranges are served from the cache. If the chunks aren't all cached, pre-fetching is used to request chunks from the backend. This optimization relies on the backend's ability to support byte-range requests. If the backend doesn't support byte-range requests, this optimization isn't effective. Recommendation # Use caching to reduce retrieving contents from origins and improve overall performance.

Front Door uses a technique called object chunking. When a large file is requested, Front Door retrieves smaller pieces of the file from the backend. After receiving a full or byte-range file request, the Front Door environment requests the file from the backend in chunks of 8 MB. After the chunk arrives at the Front Door environment, it's cached and immediately served to the user. Front Door then pre-fetches the next chunk in parallel. This pre-fetch ensures that the content stays one chunk ahead of the user, which reduces latency. This process continues until the entire file gets downloaded (if requested) or the client closes the connection. For more information on the byte-range request, read RFC 7233. Front Door caches any chunks as they're received so the entire file doesn't need to be cached on the Front Door cache. Ensuing requests for the file or byte ranges are served from the cache. If the chunks aren't all cached, pre-fetching is used to request chunks from the backend. This optimization relies on the backend's ability to support byte-range requests. If the backend doesn't support byte-range requests, this optimization isn't effective.","title":"Description"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.UseCaching/#recommendation","text":"Use caching to reduce retrieving contents from origins and improve overall performance.","title":"Recommendation"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.UseCaching/#examples","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.FrontDoor.UseCaching/#configure-with-azure-template","text":"To deploy front door instances pass this rule: Configure properties.routingRules.properties.routeConfiguration.cacheConfiguration .

Description # Network Security Groups (NSGs) are basic stateful firewalls that provide network isolation and security. NSGs allow or deny network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. i.e. Traffic between VMs on the same or different subnet can be restricted. NSGs do this by enforcing ordered access rules for all traffic in or out services attached to a subnet. This micro-segmentation approach provides a control to reduce lateral movement between services. Typically, a subset of trusted hosts such as privileged access workstations (PAWs), bastion hosts, or jump boxes will be used for management. Management protocols originating from application workload hosts should be blocked. For example: An SQL Server should not be used as a management host to manage other SQL Servers, or File Servers. Configure dedicated management hosts to manage other hosts. This helps improve security in two ways: Reduces the attack surface that can be used in lateral traversal attacks.

Description # The legacy Log Analytics agent will be retired on August 31, 2024. Before that date, you'll need to start using the Azure Monitor agent to monitor your virtual machine scale sets. The Azure Monitor agent provdes the following benefits over legacy agents: Security and performance Enhanced security through Managed Identity and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens (for clients). A higher events-per-second (EPS) upload rate. Cost savings by using data collection rules. Using DCRs is one of the most useful advantages of using Azure Monitor Agent: DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the \"all or nothing\" approach of legacy agents. With DCRs, you can define which data to ingest and which data to filter out to reduce workspace clutter and save on costs. Simpler management of data collection, including ease of troubleshooting: Easy multihoming on Windows and Linux. Centralized, \"in the cloud\" agent configuration makes every action simpler and more easily scalable throughout the data collection lifecycle, from onboarding to deployment to updates and changes over time. Greater transparency and control of more capabilities and services, such as Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and VM Insights. A single agent that consolidates all features necessary to address all telemetry data collection needs across servers and client devices running Windows 10 or 11. A single agent is the goal, although Azure Monitor Agent currently converges with the Log Analytics agents. Recommendation # Virtual Machine Scale Sets should migrate to Azure Monitor Agent.

Before that date, you'll need to start using the Azure Monitor agent to monitor your virtual machine scale sets. The Azure Monitor agent provdes the following benefits over legacy agents: Security and performance Enhanced security through Managed Identity and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens (for clients). A higher events-per-second (EPS) upload rate. Cost savings by using data collection rules. Using DCRs is one of the most useful advantages of using Azure Monitor Agent: DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the \"all or nothing\" approach of legacy agents. With DCRs, you can define which data to ingest and which data to filter out to reduce workspace clutter and save on costs. Simpler management of data collection, including ease of troubleshooting: Easy multihoming on Windows and Linux. Centralized, \"in the cloud\" agent configuration makes every action simpler and more easily scalable throughout the data collection lifecycle, from onboarding to deployment to updates and changes over time. Greater transparency and control of more capabilities and services, such as Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and VM Insights. A single agent that consolidates all features necessary to address all telemetry data collection needs across servers and client devices running Windows 10 or 11. A single agent is the goal, although Azure Monitor Agent currently converges with the Log Analytics agents.","title":"Description"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.VMSS.MigrateAMA/#recommendation","text":"Virtual Machine Scale Sets should migrate to Azure Monitor Agent.","title":"Recommendation"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.VMSS.MigrateAMA/#examples","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"en/rules/Azure.VMSS.MigrateAMA/#configure-with-azure-template","text":"To deploy virtual machine scale sets that pass this rule: Set properties.virtualMachineProfile.extensionProfile.extensions.properties.publisher to 'Microsoft.Azure.Monitor' .

ARM templates are typically not static, they include parameters, functions and conditions. Depending on the parameters provided to a template, resources may differ significantly. Important resource properties that should be validated are often variables, parameters or deployed conditionally. Under these circumstances, to correctly validate resources in a template, parameters must be resolved. The following scenario shows how PSRule can be used to validate Azure resource templates within an Azure Pipeline. This scenario covers the following: Installing PSRule extension Linking parameter files to templates Creating a YAML pipeline Installing Azure rules Exporting resource data for analysis Validating exported resources Generating NUnit output Complete example Installing PSRule extension # PSRule includes an extension that can be installed from the Visual Studio Marketplace . Once installed, Azure Pipelines tasks are available to install PSRule modules and run analysis. Linking parameter files to templates # ARM template parameter files allows parameters for a deployment to be saved and checked into source control. PSRule can automatically resolve ARM templates from parameter files by using a metadata link. To link a parameter file to an ARM template add the metadata.template property within a parameter file. For example: { \"$schema\" : \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\" , \"contentVersion\" : \"1.0.0.0\" , \"metadata\" : { \"template\" : \"./azuredeploy.json\" }, \"parameters\" : { \"vnetName\" : { \"value\" : \"vnet-001\" }, \"addressPrefix\" : { \"value\" : [ \"10.1.0.0/24\" ] } } } In the example parameter file azuredeploy.parameters.json is linked to the template azuredeploy.json . The prefix of ./ indicates that the template file is in a relative path to the parameter file. If ./ is not included, PSRule will look for the template relative to the working directory. For example: { \"$schema\" : \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\" , \"contentVersion\" : \"1.0.0.0\" , \"metadata\" : { \"template\" : \"templates/vnet-hub/v1/template.json\" }, \"parameters\" : { \"vnetName\" : { \"value\" : \"vnet-001\" }, \"addressPrefix\" : { \"value\" : [ \"10.1.0.0/24\" ] } } } Creating a YAML pipeline # Azure Pipelines supports defining pipelines in YAML.

ARM templates are typically not static, they include parameters, functions and conditions. Depending on the parameters provided to a template, resources may differ significantly. Important resource properties that should be validated are often variables, parameters or deployed conditionally. Under these circumstances, to correctly validate resources in a template, parameters must be resolved. The following scenario shows how to validate Azure resources from templates using a generic pipeline. The examples provided can be integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline able to run PowerShell. For integrating into Azure DevOps see Validate Azure resources from templates with Azure Pipelines . This scenario covers the following: Installing PSRule within a CI pipeline Exporting rule data for analysis Validating exported resources Formatting output Failing the pipeline Generating NUnit output Complete example Additional options Installing PSRule within a CI pipeline # Typically, PSRule is not pre-installed on CI worker nodes and must be installed within the pipeline. PSRule PowerShell modules need to be installed prior to calling PSRule cmdlets. If your CI pipeline runs on a persistent virtual machine that you control, consider pre-installing PSRule. The following examples focus on installing PSRule dynamically during execution of the pipeline. Which is suitable for cloud-based CI worker nodes. To install PSRule within a CI pipeline, execute the Install-Module PowerShell cmdlet. Depending on your environment, the CI worker process may not have administrative permissions. To install modules into the current context running the CI pipeline use -Scope CurrentUser . The PowerShell Gallery is not a trusted source by default. Use the -Force switch to suppress a prompt to install modules from PowerShell Gallery. For example: $Null = Install-Module -Name PSRule . Rules . Azure -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; Installing PSRule.Rules.Azure also installs the base PSRule module and associated Azure dependencies. The PSRule.Rules.Azure module includes cmdlets and pre-built rules for validating Azure resources. Using the pre-built rules is completely optional. In some cases, installing NuGet and PowerShellGet may be required to connect to the PowerShell Gallery. The NuGet package provider can be installed using the Install-PackageProvider PowerShell cmdlet. $Null = Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; The example below includes both steps together with checks: if ( $Null -eq ( Get-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue )) { $Null = Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; } if ( $Null -eq ( Get-InstalledModule -Name PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2 . 2 . 1 -ErrorAction Ignore )) { Install-Module PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2 . 2 . 1 -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber ; } if ( $Null -eq ( Get-InstalledModule -Name PSRule . Rules . Azure -MinimumVersion '0.12.1' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue )) { $Null = Install-Module -Name PSRule . Rules . Azure -Scope CurrentUser -MinimumVersion '0.12.1' -Force ; } Add -AllowPrerelease to install pre-release versions. See the change log for the latest version. Exporting rule data for analysis # In PSRule, the Export-AzRuleTemplateData cmdlet resolves a template and returns a resultant set of resources. The resultant set of resources can then be validated. No connectivity to Azure is required by default when calling Export-AzRuleTemplateData . Export cmdlet parameters # To run Export-AzRuleTemplateData two key parameters are required: -TemplateFile - An absolute or relative path to the template JSON file. -ParameterFile - An absolute or relative path to one or more parameter JSON files. The -ParameterFile parameter is optional when all parameters defined in the template have defaultValue set. Optionally the following parameters can be used: -Name - The name of the deployment. If not specified a default name of export-<xxxxxxxx> will be used. -OutputPath - An absolute or relative path where the resultant resources will be written to JSON. If not specified the current working path be used. -ResourceGroup - The name of a resource group where the deployment is intended to be run. If not specified placeholder values will be used. -Subscription - The name or subscription Id of a subscription where the deployment is intended to be run. If not specified placeholder values will be used. See cmdlet help for a full list of parameters. If -OutputPath is a directory or is not set, the output file will be automatically named resources-<name>.json . For example: Export-AzRuleTemplateData -TemplateFile .\\ template . json -ParameterFile .\\ parameters . json ; Multiple parameter files that map to the same template can be supplied in a single cmdlet call. Additional templates can be exported by calling Export-AzRuleTemplateData multiple times. Use of placeholder values # A number of functions that can be used within Azure templates retrieve information from Azure. Some examples include reference , subscription , resourceGroup , list* . The default for Export-AzRuleTemplateData is to operate without requiring authenticated connectivity to Azure. As a result, functions that retrieve information from Azure use placeholders such as {{Subscription.SubscriptionId}} . To provide a real value for subscription and resourceGroup use the -Subscription and -ResourceGroup parameters. When using -Subscription and -ResourceGroup the subscription and resource group must already exist. Additionally the context running the cmdlet must have at least read access (i.e. Reader ). It is currently not possible to provide a real value for reference and list* , only placeholders will be used. Key Vault references in parameter files use placeholders instead of the real value to prevent accidental exposure of secrets. Validating exported resources # To validate exported resources use Invoke-PSRule , Assert-PSRule or Test-PSRuleTarget . In a CI pipeline, Assert-PSRule is recommended. Assert-PSRule outputs preformatted results ideal for use within a CI pipeline. Use Assert-PSRule with the resolved resource output as an input using -InputPath . In the following example, resources from .\\resources.json are validated against pre-built rules: Assert-PSRule -InputPath .\\ resources-export -*. json -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure ; Example output: -> vnet-001 : Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks [PASS] Azure.Resource.UseTags [PASS] Azure.VirtualNetwork.UseNSGs [PASS] Azure.VirtualNetwork.SingleDNS [PASS] Azure.VirtualNetwork.LocalDNS -> vnet-001/subnet2 : Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets [FAIL] Azure.Resource.UseTags To process multiple input files a wildcard * can be used. Assert-PSRule -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure ; Formatting output # When executing a CI pipeline, feedback on any validation failures is important. The Assert-PSRule cmdlet provides easy to read formatted output instead of PowerShell objects. Additionally, Assert-PSRule supports styling formatted output for Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions. Use the -Style AzurePipelines or -Style GitHubActions parameter to style output. For example: Assert-PSRule -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json -Style AzurePipelines -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure ; Failing the pipeline # When using PSRule within a CI pipeline, a failed rule should stop the pipeline. When using Assert-PSRule if any rules fail, an error will be generated. Assert-PSRule : One or more rules reported failure. At line:1 char:1 + Assert-PSRule -Module PSRule.Rules.Azure -InputPath .\\out\\tests\\Resou ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : InvalidData: (:) [Assert-PSRule], FailPipelineException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PSRule.Fail,Assert-PSRule A single PowerShell error is typically enough to stop a CI pipeline. If you are using a different configuration additionally -ErrorAction Stop can be used. For example: Assert-PSRule -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json -ErrorAction Stop ; Generating NUnit output # NUnit is a popular unit test framework for .NET. NUnit generates a test report format that is widely interpreted by CI systems. While PSRule does not use NUnit directly, it support outputting validation results in the NUnit3 format. Using a common format allows integration with any system that supports the NUnit3 for publishing test results. To generate an NUnit report: Use the -OutputFormat NUnit3 parameter. Use the -OutputPath parameter to specify the path of the report file to write. Assert-PSRule -OutputFormat NUnit3 -OutputPath .\\ reports \\ rule-report . xml -Module PSRule . Rules . Azure -InputPath .\\ out \\*. json ; The output path will be created if it does not exist. Complete example # Putting each of these steps together.

ARM templates are typically not static, they include parameters, functions and conditions. Depending on the parameters provided to a template, resources may differ significantly. Important resource properties that should be validated are often variables, parameters or deployed conditionally. Under these circumstances, to correctly validate resources in a template, parameters must be resolved. The following scenario shows how to validate Azure resources from templates using a generic pipeline. The examples provided can be integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline able to run PowerShell.

PSRule PowerShell modules need to be installed prior to calling PSRule cmdlets. If your CI pipeline runs on a persistent virtual machine that you control, consider pre-installing PSRule. The following examples focus on installing PSRule dynamically during execution of the pipeline. Which is suitable for cloud-based CI worker nodes. To install PSRule within a CI pipeline, execute the Install-Module PowerShell cmdlet. Depending on your environment, the CI worker process may not have administrative permissions. To install modules into the current context running the CI pipeline use -Scope CurrentUser . The PowerShell Gallery is not a trusted source by default. Use the -Force switch to suppress a prompt to install modules from PowerShell Gallery. For example: $Null = Install-Module -Name PSRule . Rules . Azure -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; Installing PSRule.Rules.Azure also installs the base PSRule module and associated Azure dependencies. The PSRule.Rules.Azure module includes cmdlets and pre-built rules for validating Azure resources. Using the pre-built rules is completely optional. In some cases, installing NuGet and PowerShellGet may be required to connect to the PowerShell Gallery. The NuGet package provider can be installed using the Install-PackageProvider PowerShell cmdlet. $Null = Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; The example below includes both steps together with checks: if ( $Null -eq ( Get-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue )) { $Null = Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Scope CurrentUser -Force ; } if ( $Null -eq ( Get-InstalledModule -Name PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2 . 2 . 1 -ErrorAction Ignore )) { Install-Module PowerShellGet -MinimumVersion 2 . 2 . 1 -Scope CurrentUser -Force -AllowClobber ; } if ( $Null -eq ( Get-InstalledModule -Name PSRule .

Logging into a Log Analytics workspace # Logging of PSRule results into a workspace is done using the PSRule for Azure Monitor module. PSRule for Azure Monitor extends the PSRule pipeline to import results into the specified workspace. Once configured, PSRule will log results into the PSRule_CL custom log table of the chosen workspace. Info Integration between PSRule and Azure Monitor is done by means of a convention. Conventions extend the pipeline to be able to upload results after rules have run. Setting environment variables # PSRule for Azure Monitor requires a Log Analytics workspace to import results into. To configure the workspace to import results to the following environment variables must be set. PSRULE_CONFIGURATION_MONITOR_WORKSPACE_ID - The unique ID (GUID) for the workspace to import results. PSRULE_CONFIGURATION_MONITOR_WORKSPACE_KEY - Either the primary or secondary key of the workspace. How to set these environment variables is covered in the next section for GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines. Tip Both the workspace ID and keys can be found under the Agents management settings of the workspace.
