# Permit outbound management

As discussed in [Azure.NSG.LateralTraversal][1], outbound management traffic is expected from some subnets.
Subnets that are expected allow outbound management traffic may include:

- Privileged access workstations (PAWs)
- Bastion hosts
- Jump boxes

As a result, you may want to suppress the [Azure.NSG.LateralTraversal][1] rule on NSGs for these special cases.

!!! Abstract
    This topic provides an example you can use to configure PSRule to ignore special case NSGs.

  [1]: ../en/rules/Azure.NSG.LateralTraversal.md

## Create a suppression group

Within the `.ps-rule` sub-directory create a file called `Org.Azure.Suppressions.Rule.yaml`.
If the `.ps-rule` sub-directory does not exist, create it in the root of your repository.

Use the following snippet to populate the [suppression group][2]:

```yaml
---
# Synopsis: Ignore NSG lateral movement for management subnet NSGs such as Azure Bastion.
apiVersion: github.com/microsoft/PSRule/v1
kind: SuppressionGroup
metadata:
  name: Org.Azure.PermitOutboundManagement
spec:
  rule:
  - PSRule.Rules.Azure\Azure.NSG.LateralTraversal
  if:
    allOf:
    - type: '.'
      in:
      - Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups

    # Suppress NSGs with bastion or management in thier name
    - name: '.'
      contains:
      - bastion
      - management
```

Some key points to call out with the [suppression group][2] snippet include:

- The name of the suppression group is `Org.Azure.PermitOutboundManagement`.
  Each resource name must be unique.
- The suppression group applies to:
  - The rule `PSRule.Rules.Azure\Azure.NSG.LateralTraversal`.
  - Run against NSGs with the type `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups`.
  - When the name of the NSG contains `bastion` or `management`.
    The [suppression group][2] uses [expressions][3] to determine when a resource is suppressed.
    Update this condition to match your environment.
    For example, the following NSGs would be suppressed by this suppression group:
    - `nsg-bastion-prod-eus-001`
    - `nsg-hub-management-prod-001`
- The synopsis comment above the suppression group is included in output as the explaination for the suppression.

!!! Tip
    [Expressions][3] can be combined within a [suppression group][2] using `allOf` or `anyOf` operators.
