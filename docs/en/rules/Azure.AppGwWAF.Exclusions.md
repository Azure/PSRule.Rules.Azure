# Application Gateway rules are enabled

## SYNOPSIS

Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) should have all rules enabled.

## DESCRIPTION

Application Gateway instances with WAF allow OWASP detection/ prevention rules to be toggled on or off.
All OWASP rules are turned on by default.

When OWASP rules are turned off, the protection they provide is disabled.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider enabling all OWASP rules within Application Gateway instances.

Before disabling OWASP rules, ensure that the backend workload has alternative protections in-place.
Alternatively consider updating application code to use safe web standards.
