# Enable Front Door WAF policy

## SYNOPSIS

Front Door Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy must be enabled to protect back end resources.

## DESCRIPTION

The operational state of a Front Door WAF policy instance is configurable, either enabled or disabled.
By default, a WAF policy is enabled.

When disabled, incoming requests bypass the WAF policy and are sent to back ends based on routing rules.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider enabling WAF policy.
