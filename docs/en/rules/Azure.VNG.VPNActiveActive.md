# Use Active-Active VPN gateways

## SYNOPSIS

Use VPN gateways configured to operate in an Active-Active configuration to reduce connectivity downtime.

## DESCRIPTION

VPN Gateways can be configured as either Active-Passive or Active-Active for Site-to-Site (S2S) connections.
When deploying VPN gateways, Azure deploys two instances for high-availability (HA).

When using an Active-Passive configuration, one instance is designated a standby for failover.

Gateways configured to use an Active-Active configuration:

- Establish two IPSEC tunnels, one from each instance per connection.
- Each instance will load balance network traffic.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider using Active-Active VPN gateways to reduce connectivity downtime during HA failover.

## NOTES

Azure provisions a single instance for Basic (legacy) VPN gateways.
As a result, Basic VPN gateways do not support Active-Active connections.
To use Active-Active VPN connections, migrate to a gateway configured as VpnGw1 or higher SKU.
