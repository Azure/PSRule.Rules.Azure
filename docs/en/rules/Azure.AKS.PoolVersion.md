# Upgrade AKS node pool version

## SYNOPSIS

AKS node pools should match Kubernetes control plane version.

## DESCRIPTION

AKS supports multiple node pools.
In a multi-node pool configuration, it is possible that the control plane and node pools could be running a different version of Kubernetes.

Different versions of Kubernetes between the control plane and node pools is intended as a short term option to allow rolling upgrades.
For general operation, the control plane and node pool Kubernetes versions should match.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider upgrading node pools to match AKS control plan version.
