# Use Application Gateway WAF policy in prevention mode

## SYNOPSIS

Use protection mode in Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) policies to protect back end resources.

## DESCRIPTION

Application Gateway WAF policies support two modes of operation, detection and prevention.
By default, prevention is configured.

- Detection - monitors and logs all requests which match a WAF rule.
In this mode, the WAF doesn't take action against incoming requests.
To log requests, diagnostics on the Application Gateway instance must be configured.
- Protection - log and takes action against requests which match a WAF rule.
The action to perform is configurable for each WAF rule.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider setting Application Gateway WAF policy to use protection mode.
