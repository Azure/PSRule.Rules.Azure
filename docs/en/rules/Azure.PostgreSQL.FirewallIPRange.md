# Limit PostgreSQL server firewall rule range

## SYNOPSIS

Determine if there is an excessive number of permitted IP addresses.

## DESCRIPTION

Typically the number of IP address rules permitted through the firewall is minimal, with management connectivity from on-premises and cloud application connectivity the most common.

## RECOMMENDATION

The PostgreSQL server has greater then ten (10) public IP addresses that are permitted network access. Some rules may not be needed or can be reduced.
