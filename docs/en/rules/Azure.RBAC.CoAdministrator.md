# Use role-based access control

## SYNOPSIS

Delegate access to manage Azure resources using role-based access control (RBAC).

## DESCRIPTION

Use of Co-administrator is intended to support management of resources deployed using the Classic deployment model.
Resources deployed in the Resource Manager model do not require delegation of Co-administrators.

Azure RBAC provides greater flexibility and control providing over 100 built-in roles.
Additionally RBAC works with advanced advanced security features like Privileged Identity Management (PIM).

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider delegating access to manage Azure resources using RBAC instead of classic Co-administrator roles.
Limit delegation of Co-administrator roles only to subscription that contain resources deployed in the Classic deployment model.
