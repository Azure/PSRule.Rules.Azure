# Use valid App Configuration store names

## SYNOPSIS

App Configuration store names should meet naming requirements.

## DESCRIPTION

When naming Azure resources, resource names must meet service requirements.
The requirements for App Configuration store names are:

- Between 5 and 50 characters long.
- Alphanumerics and hyphens.
- Start and end with a letter or number.
- App Configuration store names must be unique within a resource group.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider using names that meet App Configuration store naming requirements.
Additionally consider naming resources with a standard naming convention.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To deploy configuration stores that pass this rule:

- Set `name` to a value that meets the requirements.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores",
  "apiVersion": "2022-05-01",
  "name": "[parameters('name')]",
  "location": "[parameters('location')]",
  "sku": {
    "name": "standard"
  },
  "properties": {
    "disableLocalAuth": true,
    "enablePurgeProtection": true
  }
}
```

### Configure with Bicep

To deploy configuration stores that pass this rule:

- Set `name` to a value that meets the requirements.

For example:

```bicep
resource store 'Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores@2022-05-01' = {
  name: name
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'standard'
  }
  properties: {
    disableLocalAuth: true
    enablePurgeProtection: true
  }
}
```

## NOTES

This rule does not check if App Configuration store names are unique.
