# Set Microsoft Defender for ARM to the Standard tier

## SYNOPSIS

Enable Microsoft Defender for Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

## DESCRIPTION

Microsoft Defender for ARM provides additional protection for control plane activities.
It does this by detecting suspicious activities such as disabling security features or attempts at lateral movement.

Protection is provided by analyzing telemetry from Azure Resource Manager operations.
Which allows Microsoft Defender for Cloud to detect anomalous activities regardless of the tool used to perform the operation.
For example: Azure CLI, Azure Portal, PowerShell, REST API, Terraform, etc.

When anomalous activities occur, Microsoft Defender for ARM shows alerts to relevant members of your organization.
These alerts include the details of the suspicious activity and recommendations on how to investigate and remediate threats.

Microsoft Defender for ARM can be enabled at the subscription level.
