# Enable continuous backup policy

## SYNOPSIS

Enable continuous backup on Cosmos DB accounts.

## DESCRIPTION

Continuous backup for Azure Cosmos DB captures changes in near real-time, ensuring that you always have the most up-to-date backup.
Data can be restored to any restorable timestamp within the retention period.

Benefits of continuous backup include:

- **Accidental Write or Delete Recovery**: Quickly recover from unintended changes within a container.
- **Comprehensive Restoration**: Restore deleted accounts, databases, or containers.
- **Regional Flexibility**: Restore data into any region where backups existed at the desired restore point.
- **Ease of Use**: Restore data directly through the Azure portal without needing support requests.

These features typically improve your:

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: How long it take to recover, and systems are back online.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The point in time you can recover to.

Continuous backup involves additional costs, so it is recommended for mission-critical applications with frequent data changes.

Check the documentation below for important information and limitations.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider configuring Azure Cosmos DB with continuous backup mode for enhanced data protection (RTO & RPO) and easier recovery.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To configure continuous backup for Cosmos DB:

- Set the `properties.backupPolicy.type` property to `Continuous`.
- Set the `properties.backupPolicy.continuousModeProperties.tier` property to a valid tier.
  Valid tiers include `Continuous7Days` and `Continuous30Days`.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts",
  "apiVersion": "2024-05-15",
  "name": "[parameters('name')]",
  "location": "[parameters('location')]",
  "kind": "GlobalDocumentDB",
  "properties": {
    "disableLocalAuth": true,
    "locations": [
      {
        "locationName": "[parameters('location')]",
        "failoverPriority": 0,
        "isZoneRedundant": true
      }
    ],
    "backupPolicy": {
      "type": "Continuous",
      "continuousModeProperties": {
        "tier": "Continuous7Days"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure with Bicep

To configure continuous backup for Cosmos DB:

- Set the `properties.backupPolicy.type` property to `Continuous`.
- Set the `properties.backupPolicy.continuousModeProperties.tier` property to a valid tier.
  Valid tiers include `Continuous7Days` and `Continuous30Days`.

For example:

```bicep
resource account 'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts@2024-05-15' = {
  name: name
  location: location
  kind: 'GlobalDocumentDB'
  properties: {
    disableLocalAuth: true
    locations: [
      {
        locationName: location
        failoverPriority: 0
        isZoneRedundant: true
      }
    ]
    backupPolicy: {
      type: 'Continuous'
      continuousModeProperties: {
        tier: 'Continuous30Days'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## NOTES

Azure Cosmos DB API for Cassandra does not support continuous backup mode currently.
