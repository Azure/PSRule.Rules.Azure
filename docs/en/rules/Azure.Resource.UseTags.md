# Use resource tags

## SYNOPSIS

Azure resources should be tagged using a standard convention.

## DESCRIPTION

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) supports a flexible tagging model that allows each resource to be tagged.
Tags are additional metadata that improves identification of resources and aids lifecycle management.

Azure stores tags as name/ value pairs such as `environment = production` or `costCode = 349921`.

A well defined tagging approach improves the management, billing and automation operations of resources.
When planning tags, identify information that is meaningful to business and technical staff.

Azure provides several built-in policies to managed tags.
Using these policies help enforce a tagging standard can reduce overall management
Resource tags can be inherited from subscriptions or resource groups using Azure Policy.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider tagging resources using a standard convention.
Identify mandatory and optional tags then tag all resources and resource groups using this standard.

Also consider using Azure Policy to enforce mandatory tags.

## NOTES

Azure Policy includes the following built-in policies to enforce tagging:

- Require a tag on resources
- Require a tag on resource groups
