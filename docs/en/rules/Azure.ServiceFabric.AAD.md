# Use AAD authentication with Service Fabric clusters

## SYNOPSIS

Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) client authentication for Service Fabric clusters.

## DESCRIPTION

When deploying Service Fabric clusters on Azure, AAD can optionally be used to secure management endpoints.
If configured, client authentication (client-to-node security) uses AAD.
Additionally Azure Role-based Access Control (RBAC) can be used to delegate cluster access.

For Service Fabric clusters running on Azure, AAD is recommended to secure access to management endpoints.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider enabling Azure Active Directory (AAD) client authentication for Service Fabric clusters.

## NOTES

For Linux clusters, AAD authentication must be configured at cluster creation time.
Windows cluster can be updated to support AAD authentication after initial deployment.
