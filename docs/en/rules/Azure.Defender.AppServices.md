## DESCRIPTION

Many attacks are performed first by probing web applications to find and exploit weaknesses.
It is crucial to secure your applications, even while running in PaaS services like App Service.

Microsoft Defender for App Service identifies attacks over App Service thanks to cloud scale data analysis.
It offers:

- Hardening capabilities for your App Services through assessments and security recommendations.
- Detection of threats at different levels such as underlying VMs, internal logs, I/O to your App Service, etc.
- Protection against common attack patterns like MITRE ATT&CK or even dangling DNS.

The solution is particularly efficient as it can can identify attack methodologies applying to multiple targets.
The log data and the infrastructure together are used to enhance Defender for App Service globally.
