# Use an SLA for Web PubSub Services

## SYNOPSIS

Use SKUs that include an SLA when configuring Web PubSub Services.

## DESCRIPTION

When choosing a SKU for a Web PubSub Service you should consider the SLA that is included in the SKU.
Web PubSub Services offer a range of SKU offerings:

- `Free` - Are designed for early non-production use and do not include any SLA.
- `Standard` - Are designed for production use and include an SLA.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider using a Standard SKU that includes an SLA.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To deploy services that pass this rule:

- Set `sku.name` to `Standard_S1`.

For example:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.SignalRService/webPubSub",
    "apiVersion": "2021-10-01",
    "name": "[parameters('name')]",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "sku": {
        "name": "Standard_S1"
    },
    "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned"
    },
    "properties": {
        "disableLocalAuth": true
    }
}
```

### Configure with Bicep

To deploy services that pass this rule:

- Set `sku.name` to `Standard_S1`.

For example:

```bicep
resource service 'Microsoft.SignalRService/webPubSub@2021-10-01' = {
  name: name
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_S1'
  }
  identity: {
    type: 'SystemAssigned'
  }
  properties: {
    disableLocalAuth: true
  }
}
```
