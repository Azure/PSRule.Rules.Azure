# Use Azure role-based access control

## SYNOPSIS

Key Vaults should use Azure RBAC as the authorization system for the data plane.

## DESCRIPTION

Azure RBAC is the recommended authorization system for the Azure Key Vault data plane.

Azure RBAC allows users to manage key, secrets, and certificates permissions. It provides one place to manage all permissions across all Key Vaults.

Azure RBAC for Key Vault also allows users to have separate permissions on individual keys, secrets, and certificates.

The Azure RBAC permission model is not enabled by default.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider using Azure RBAC as the authorization system on Key Vaults for the data plane.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To deploy Key Vaults that pass this rule:

- Set the `properties.enableRbacAuthorization` property to `true`.

For example:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults",
    "apiVersion": "2022-07-01",
    "name": "[parameters('name')]",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "properties": {
        "sku": {
            "family": "A",
            "name": "standard"
        },
        "tenantId": "[subscription().tenantId]",
        "enableRbacAuthorization": true
    }
}
```

### Configure with Bicep

To deploy Key Vaults that pass this rule:

- Set the `properties.enableRbacAuthorization` property to `true`.

For example:

```bicep
resource vault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2022-07-01' = {
  name: name
  location: location
  properties: {
    sku: {
      family: 'A'
      name: 'standard'
    }
    tenantId: subscription().tenantId
    enableRbacAuthorization: true
  }
}
```

### Configure with Azure CLI

```bash
az keyvault update -n '<name>' -g '<resource_group>' --enable-rbac-authorization
```

### Configure with Azure PowerShell

```powershell
Update-AzKeyVault -ResourceGroupName '<resource_group>' -Name '<name>' -EnableRbacAuthorization
```

## NOTES

The RBAC permission model may not be suitable for all use cases.
If this rule is not suitable for your use case, you can exclude or suppress the rule.
