# Avoid configuring Front Door WAF rule exclusions

## SYNOPSIS

Use recommended rule groups in Front Door Web Application Firewall (WAF) policies to protect back end resources.
Avoid configuring rule exclusions.

## DESCRIPTION

Front Door WAF supports exclusions lists.

Sometimes Web Application Firewall (WAF) might block a request that you want to allow for your application.
WAF exclusion lists allow you to omit certain request attributes from a WAF evaluation.
However, it should be allowed and only used as a last resort.

## RECOMMENDATION

Avoid configuring Front Door WAF rule exclusions.
