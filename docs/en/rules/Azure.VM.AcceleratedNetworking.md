# Use accelerated networking

## SYNOPSIS

Use accelerated networking for supported operating systems and VM types.

## DESCRIPTION

Enabling accelerated networking for a virtual machine (VM) greatly improves networking performance.
Accelerated networking work by enabling single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM.
SR-IOV reduces latency, jitter, and CPU utilization network demanding workloads.

Accelerated networking is available for supported operating systems and VM types.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider enabling accelerated networking for supported operating systems and VM types.
