# Use short lived web hooks

## SYNOPSIS

Do not create webhooks with an expiry time greater than 1 year (default).

## DESCRIPTION

Do not create webhooks with an expiry time greater than 1 year (default).

## RECOMMENDATION

An expiry time of 1 year is the default for webhook creation.
Webhooks should be programmatically rotated at regular intervals - Microsoft recommends setting a shorter time than the default of 1 year.
If authentication is required for a webhook consider implementing a pre-shared key in the header - or using an Azure Function.
