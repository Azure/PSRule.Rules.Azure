# Use managed identity for authentication

## SYNOPSIS

Ensure managed identity is used for authentication.

## DESCRIPTION

Using managed identities have the following benefits:

- Your app connects to resources with the managed identity. You don't need to manage credentials in your container app.
- You can use role-based access control to grant specific permissions to a managed identity.
- System-assigned identities are automatically created and managed. They're deleted when your container app is deleted.
- You can add and delete user-assigned identities and assign them to multiple resources. They're independent of your container app's life cycle.
- You can use managed identity to authenticate with a private Azure Container Registry without a username and password to pull containers for your Container App.
- You can use managed identity to create connections for Dapr-enabled applications via Dapr components.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider configure a managed identity for each container app.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To deploy Container Apps that pass this rule:

- Set `identity.type` to `SystemAssigned` or `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned,UserAssigned`.
- If `identity.type` is `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned,UserAssigned`, reference the identity with `identity.userAssignedIdentities`.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.App/containerApps",
  "apiVersion": "2022-10-01",
  "name": "[parameters('appName')]",
  "location": "[parameters('location')]",
  "identity": {
    "type": "SystemAssigned",
    "userAssignedIdentities": {}
  },
  "properties": {}
}
```
 
### Configure with Bicep

To deploy Container Apps that pass this rule:

- Set `identity.type` to `SystemAssigned` or `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned,UserAssigned`.
- If `identity.type` is `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned,UserAssigned`, reference the identity with `identity.userAssignedIdentities`.

For example:

```bicep
resource containerApp 'Microsoft.App/containerApps@2022-10-01' = {
  name: appName
  location: location
  identity: {
    type: 'SystemAssigned'
    userAssignedIdentities: {}
  }
  properties: {}
}
```

## NOTES

Using managed identities in scale rules isn't supported.
