# Application Gateway rules are enabled

## SYNOPSIS

Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) should have all rules enabled.

## DESCRIPTION

Application Gateway instances with WAF allow OWASP detection/ prevention rules to be toggled on or off.
All OWASP rules are turned on by default.

When OWASP rules are turned off, the protection they provide is disabled.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider enabling all OWASP rules within Application Gateway instances.

Before disabling OWASP rules, ensure that the backend workload has alternative protections in-place.
Alternatively consider updating application code to use safe web standards.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To deploy Application Gateways that pass this rule:

- Set the `properties.webApplicationFirewallConfiguration.disabledRuleGroups.ruleGroupName` property to `$ruleName`.

For example:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways",
    "apiVersion": "2020-11-01",
    "name": "appGw-001",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "properties": {
        "sku": {
            "name": "WAF_v2",
            "tier": "WAF_v2"
        },
        "webApplicationFirewallConfiguration": {
            "enabled": true,
            "firewallMode": "Prevention",
            "ruleSetType": "OWASP",
            "ruleSetVersion": "3.2",
            "disabledRuleGroups": [
              {
                "ruleGroupName": "exampleRule",
                "rules": []
              }
            ],
            "requestBodyCheck": true,
            "maxRequestBodySizeInKb": 128,
            "fileUploadLimitInMb": 100
        }
    }
}
```

### Configure with Bicep

To deploy Application Gateways that pass this rule:

- Set the `properties.webApplicationFirewallConfiguration.enabled` property to `true`.

For example:

```bicep
resource appGw 'Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways@2021-02-01' = {
  name: 'appGw-001'
  location: location
  properties: {
    sku: {
      name: 'WAF_v2'
      tier: 'WAF_v2'
    }
    webApplicationFirewallConfiguration: {
      enabled: true
      firewallMode: 'Prevention'
      ruleSetType: 'OWASP'
      ruleSetVersion: '3.2'
      disabledRuleGroups: [
        {
          ruleGroupName: 'exampleRule',
          rules: []
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
