# Use JiT role activation with PIM

## SYNOPSIS

Use just-in-time (JiT) activation of roles instead of persistent role assignment.

## DESCRIPTION

PIM helps manage the impact of identity compromise or misuse of permissions by reducing persistent access.
With PIM, eligible identities can activate time-bound role assignments on an as needed basis (just-in-time).
Activation typically occurs before a schedule change or management operation.

PIM is an Azure Active Directory (AD) feature included in Azure AD Premium P2.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider using Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to activate privileged roles on an as needed basis.
