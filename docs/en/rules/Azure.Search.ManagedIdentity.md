# Search services uses a managed identity

## SYNOPSIS

Configure managed identities to access Azure resources.

## DESCRIPTION

Connections to Azure resources is required to use some features including indexing and customer managed-keys.
Cognitive Search can use managed identities to authenticate to Azure resource without storing credentials.

Using Azure managed identities have the following benefits:

- You don't need to store or manage credentials.
  Azure automatically generates tokens and performs rotation.
- You can use managed identities to authenticate to any Azure service that supports Azure AD authentication.
- Managed identities can be used without any additional cost.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider configuring a managed identity for each Cognitive Search service.
Also consider using managed identities to authenticate to related Azure services.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To deploy Cognitive Search services that pass this rule:

- Set the `identity.type` to `SystemAssigned`.

For example:

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "2020-08-01",
    "name": "[parameters('serviceName')]",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "type": "Microsoft.Search/searchServices",
    "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned"
    },
    "sku": {
        "name": "[parameters('sku')]"
    },
    "properties": {
        "replicaCount": 3,
        "partitionCount": 1,
        "hostingMode": "default"
    },
    "tags": {},
    "dependsOn": []
}
```
