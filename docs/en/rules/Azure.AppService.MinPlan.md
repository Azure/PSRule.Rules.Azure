# Use App Service production SKU

## SYNOPSIS

Use at least a Standard App Service Plan.

## DESCRIPTION

Azure App Services provide a range of different plans that can be used to scale your application.
Each plan provides different levels of performance and features.

To get you started a number of entry level plans are available.
The `Free`, `Shared`, and `Basic` plans can be used for limited testing and development.
However these plans are not suitable for production use.
Production workloads are best suited to standard and premium plans with `PremiumV3` the newest plan.

This rule does not apply to consumption or elastic App Services Plans used for Azure Functions.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider using a standard or premium plan for hosting apps on Azure App Service.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To deploy App Services Plans that pass this rule:

- Set `sku.tier` to a plan equal to or greater than `Standard`.
  For example: `PremiumV3`, `PremiumV2`, `Premium`, `Standard`

For example:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
    "apiVersion": "2021-01-15",
    "name": "[parameters('planName')]",
    "location": "[parameters('location')]",
    "sku": {
        "name": "S1",
        "tier": "Standard",
        "capacity": 2
    }
}
```

### Configure with Bicep

To deploy App Services Plans that pass this rule:

- Set `sku.tier` to a plan equal to or greater than `Standard`.
  For example: `PremiumV3`, `PremiumV2`, `Premium`, `Standard`

For example:

```bicep
resource appPlan 'Microsoft.Web/serverfarms@2021-01-15' = {
  name: planName
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'S1'
    tier: 'Standard'
