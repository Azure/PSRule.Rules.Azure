# Deploy app service environments using availability zones

## SYNOPSIS

Deploy app service environments using availability zones in supported regions to ensure high availability and resilience.

## DESCRIPTION

App Service Environments support zone redundancy, which distributes your application running within the environment across Availablity Zones.
Each Availability Zone is a group of phyiscally separated data centers.
Deploying your application with zone redundancy:

- Scales your plan within the environment to a minimum of 3 instances in a highly available configuration.
  Additional instances can be added manually or on-demand by using autoscale.
- Improves the resiliency against service disruptions or issues affecting a single zone.

Additionally:

- **Even Distribution**: If the instance count is larger than 3 and divisible by 3, instances are evenly distributed across the three zones.
- **Partial Distribution**: Instance counts beyond 3*N are spread across the remaining one or two zones to ensure balanced distribution.

**Important** Configuring zone redundancy with per-application scaling is possible but may increase costs and administrative overhead.
When `perSiteScaling` is enabled, each application can have its own scaling rules and run on dedicated instances.
To maintain zone redundancy, it is crucial that each applicationâ€™s scaling rules ensure a minimum of 3 instances.
Without explicitly configuring this minimum, the application may not meet the zone redundancy requirement.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider using enabling zone redundancy using availability zones to improve the resiliency of your solution.

## EXAMPLES

### Configure with Azure template

To configure a zone-redundant app service environment:

- Set the `properties.zoneRedundant` property to `true`.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments",
  "apiVersion": "2022-09-01",
  "name": "[parameters('name')]",
  "location": "[parameters('location')]",
  "kind": "ASEV3",
  "properties": {
    "zoneRedundant": true
  }
}
```

### Configure with Bicep

To configure a zone-redundant app service environment:

- Set the `properties.zoneRedundant` property to `true`.

For example:

```bicep
resource ase 'Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments@2022-09-01' = {
  name: name
  location: location
  kind 'ASEV3'
  properties: {
    zoneRedundant: true
  }
}
```

## NOTES

Zone-redundancy is only supported for the `ASEV3` version.

Zone-redundancy is not supported for environments deployed on a dedicated host group.
