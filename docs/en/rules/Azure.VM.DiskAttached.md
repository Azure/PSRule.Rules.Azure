# Remove unused managed disks

## SYNOPSIS

## DESCRIPTION

Unattached managed disks are charged but not in use.
Unattached managed disks still consume storage and are charged on their size.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider removing managed disks that are no longer required to reduce complexity and costs.
