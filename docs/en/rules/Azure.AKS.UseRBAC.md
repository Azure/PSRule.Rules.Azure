# AKS clusters use RBAC

## SYNOPSIS

Deploy AKS cluster with role-based access control (RBAC) enabled.

## DESCRIPTION

AKS supports granting access to cluster resources using role-based access control (RBAC).
Additionally Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration with AKS allows, RBAC to be granted based on AAD user or group.

## RECOMMENDATION

Azure AD integration with AKS provides granular access control for Kubernetes resources using RBAC.

RBAC is a deployment time configuration.
Consider redeploying the AKS cluster with RBAC enabled.
