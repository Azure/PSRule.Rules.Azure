# Use aligned availability sets

## SYNOPSIS

Use availability sets aligned with managed disks fault domains.

## DESCRIPTION

Availability sets can be configured to align with managed disk fault domains.
When aligned, the fault domain for storage is co-located with compute.
Aligned availability sets help prevent compute and storage from a single VM spanning multiple fault domains.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider deploying VMs with managed disks into aligned availability sets.
