# Use Front Door WAF policy in prevention mode

## SYNOPSIS

Use protection mode in Front Door Web Application Firewall (WAF) policies to protect back end resources.

## DESCRIPTION

Front Door WAF policies support two modes of operation, detection and prevention.
By default, prevention is configured.

- Detection - monitors and logs all requests which match a WAF rule.
In this mode, the WAF doesn't take action against incoming requests.
To log requests, diagnostics on the Front Door instance must be configured.
- Protection - log and takes action against requests which match a WAF rule.
The action to perform is configurable for each WAF rule.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider setting Front Door WAF policy to use protection mode.
