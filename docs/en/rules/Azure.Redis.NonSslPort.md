# Use secure connections to Redis instances

## SYNOPSIS

Azure Cache for Redis should only accept secure connections.

## DESCRIPTION

Azure Cache for Redis is configured to accept unencrypted connections using a non-SSL port.
Unencrypted connections are disabled by default.

Unencrypted communication to Redis Cache could allow disclosure of information to an untrusted party.

## RECOMMENDATION

Azure Cache for Redis should be configured to only accept secure connections.

When the non-SSL port is enabled, encrypted and unencrypted connections are permitted.
To prevent unencrypted connections, disable the non-SSL port.

Unless explicitly required, consider disabling the non-SSL port.
