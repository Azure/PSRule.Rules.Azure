# Microsoft cloud security benchmark

Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) is a set of controls and recommendations that help improve the security of
workloads on Azure and your multi-cloud environment.
Controls from the MCSB are also mapped to industry frameworks, such as CIS, PCI-DSS, and NIST.

If you are new to MCSB or are looking for guidance on how to use it,
please see the [Introduction to the Microsoft cloud security benchmark][1].

## Microsoft cloud security benchmark v1

Is the latest version of the MCSB.
Rules included within PSRule for Azure have been mapped to [v1][2] so that you are able to understand the impact of the rules.
This is particularly useful when you are looking to understand how to address a compliance requirement specific to your organization.

The following controls are included in the Microsoft cloud security benchmark v1:

- [Network security (NS)][3]
- [Identity Management (IM)][4]
- [Privileged Access (PA)][5]
- [Data Protection (DP)][6]
- [Asset Management (AM)][7]
- [Logging and Threat Detection (LT)][8]
- [Incident Response (IR)][9]
- [Posture and Vulnerability Management (PV)][10]
- [Endpoint Security (ES)][11]
- [Backup and Recovery (BR)][12]
- [DevOps Security (DS)][13]
- [Governance and Strategy (GS)][14]

### Using the MCSB v1 baseline

:octicons-beaker-24:{ .experimental } Experimental Â· :octicons-milestone-24: v1.25.0

To start using the MCSB v1 baseline with PSRule, [configure the baseline parameter][18] to use `Azure.MCSB.v1`.
View the [list of rules associated with the MCSB v1 baseline][15].

!!! Experimental "Experimental - [Learn more][19]"
    MCSB baselines are a work in progress and subject to change.
    We hope to add more rules to the baseline in the future.
    [Join or start a discussion][16] to let us know how we can improve this feature going forward.

!!! Note
    It's important to note that the MCSB v1 baseline is subset of rules from the Well-Architected Framework.
    Not all rules for the Well-Architected Framework are included in MCSB.
    Using the MCSB v1 baseline is useful to understand alignment with the MCSB and other industry frameworks / standards.
    For a complete set of rules for the Well-Architected Framework, consider using a [quarterly baseline][17].
