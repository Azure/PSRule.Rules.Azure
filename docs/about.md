# What is PSRule for Azure?

PSRule for Azure is a pre-built set of tests and documentation to help you configure Azure solutions.
These tests allow you to check your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) before or after deployment to Azure.
PSRule for Azure includes tests that check how IaC is written and how Azure resources are configured.

## Why use PSRule for Azure?

PSRule for Azure helps you identify changes to improve the quality of solutions deployed on Azure.
PSRule for Azure uses the principles of the Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF) to:

- **Suggest changes** &mdash; you can use to improve the quality of your solution.
- **Link to documentation** &mdash; to learn how this applies to your environment.
- **Demonstrate** &mdash; how you can implement the change with examples.

If you want to write your own tests, you can do that too in your choice of YAML, JSON, or PowerShell.
However with over 360 tests already built, you can identify and fix issues day one.
