Welcome to the September 2025 release of PSRule for Azure.
This release includes new features, new rules and improvements to existing rules.

See the [change log][6] or [GitHub history][7] for a complete list of changes.

## Maturity aligned baseline

TBA

## CSV baseline downloads

You can now download as CSV list of rules for each baseline from baseline documentation.
This makes it easier to perform review and keep track of rules for a specific built-in baseline.

## Improved detection for Azure Container Registry

New rules have been added to improve security by:

- Ensuring export policy is disabled for private registries.
- Ensuring geo-replication is configured only in allowed regions.

Additionally, the reliability rule `Azure.ACR.GeoReplica` has been expanded to support pre-flight validation.
