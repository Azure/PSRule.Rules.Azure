Welcome to the May 2025 release of PSRule for Azure.
This release includes new features and improvements to existing rules.

## Improved support for Bicep

When new language features are released in Bicep, it may be necessary to update the PSRule for Azure to support them.
In the Azure Bicep release v0.35.1, several new functions and features were added that affect in-flight expansion and rules.

With this release we have added the support for the following new functions:

- `parseUri`
- `buildUri`

Additionally, we have added support secure outputs with the new `@secure()` decorator.

## Thank you

Thanks for your continued support and feedback.
We are always looking for ways to improve the experience of using PSRule for Azure.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please reach out to us on [GitHub Discussions][3] or [GitHub Issues][4].

If you'd like to contribute to the project, please check out our [contributing guide][5].
We welcome contributions of all kinds, from rules, code, documentation, and samples.
