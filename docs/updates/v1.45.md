Welcome to the June 2025 release of PSRule for Azure.
This release includes new features, new rules and improvements to existing rules.

See the [change log][6] or [GitHub history][7] for a complete list of changes.

## Optimization to policy as rules

Policy as rules performs additional optimization during export and code generation to improve performance and
reduce complexity of generated rules.

First, this release also introduces native support for exporting policy assignments, removing the
dependency on the `Az.Resources` PowerShell module. This provides:

- **Improved reliability** &mdash; Direct integration with Azure REST APIs eliminates potential
  module compatibility issues.
- **Better performance** &mdash; Streamlined export process with fewer dependencies and reduced
  overhead.
- **Enhanced maintainability** &mdash; Simplified codebase with direct control over the export
  functionality.

Finally, the policy as rules code generation now includes several key optimizations:

- **Nested allOf/anyOf flattening** &mdash; Deeply nested logical conditions are automatically
  flattened to reduce complexity and improve readability of generated rules.
- **Peer condition merging** &mdash; Multiple conditions targeting the same field are merged where
  possible to create more efficient rule logic.
- **Condition inversion** &mdash; Inverted conditions using `not` operators are automatically
  flattened where possible for better performance.

These optimizations result in more efficient, readable, and maintainable policy as rules
implementations while reducing the complexity of the generated rule conditions.
