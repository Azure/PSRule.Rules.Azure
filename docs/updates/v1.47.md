Welcome to the December 2025 release of PSRule for Azure.
This release includes new features, new rules and improvements to existing rules.

See the [change log][1] or [GitHub history][2] for a complete list of changes.

## Expanded support for CAF naming

Support for CAF naming conventions has been expanded with new rules to cover additional resource types.
The new rules help enforce consistent, CAF-aligned resource names across environments.

New resource types supported for enforcing naming conventions include:

- `Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups`
- `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries`
- `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters`
- `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools`
- `Microsoft.App/containerApps`
- `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments`
- `Microsoft.App/jobs`
- `Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts`
- `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases`
- `Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/serverGroupsv2`
- `Microsoft.DBforMySQL/servers`
- `Microsoft.DBforMySQL/flexibleServers`
- `Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/servers`
- `Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers`
- `Microsoft.Cache/redis`
- `Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise`
- `Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters`
- `Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedClusters`
- `Microsoft.Sql/servers`
- `Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases`
- `Microsoft.Sql/servers/elasticPools`
- `Microsoft.Sql/servers/jobAgents`
- `Microsoft.Sql/managedInstances`

## New baselines

This release adds three built-in baselines published for December 2025:

- `Azure.GA_2025_12` — General Availability aligned baseline containing rules that match broadly available Azure service behavior and hardening recommendations.
- `Azure.Preview_2025_12` — Preview aligned baseline that includes additional rules for preview features and newer service capabilities.
- `Azure.CAF_2025_12` — Cloud Adoption Framework focused baseline designed to help enforce naming, tagging and recommended conventions for enterprise adoption.

See examples of using baselines in the [Working with baselines](../working-with-baselines.md#using-baselines) documentation.
